  4. About Us 

The economics major provides rigorous training in how to analyze important
issues based on theory and data and how individuals, firms, and policymakers
can use these methods to make good decisions.

* * *

We educate undergraduate and graduate level students; we advance knowledge
within the discipline; and we help our local, national, and international
communities probe the economic dilemmas of the world today. We do this through
teaching, scholarly research, and community outreach involving:

  * The analytical tools for understanding how economic choices are made and the repercussions of those choices.
  * The empirical methods needed to explore economic issues using the data of the contemporary world and of the past.
  * The application of analysis and empirical methods to illuminate debates about important issues of the day, such as poverty, economic development and growth, globalization, and economic and social policy.

Our understanding of economics is shaped by the recognition that economics
serves society and that at the heart of each economic decision is a human
being.
