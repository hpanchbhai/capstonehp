Abstract

This study examines whether the female earnings gap results from gender
differences in preferences for competition and confidence. We use laboratory
experiments on college seniors to measure tastes for competition and
confidence and then track these subjects’ labor market experiences in the
early years after college. Women's compensation is positively correlated with
preferences for competition coupled with confidence while men's compensation
is not. Women who exhibit a taste to compete and are confident about their
performance earn substantially more than other women and do not earn less than
men. Further, enjoying competition or being confident alone is insufficient to
raise compensation. Half of this female earnings’ effect is explained by
college major and labor market controls, but even controlling for these
characteristics, a higher taste for competition for the most confident women
results in more than a 7% increase in compensation.
