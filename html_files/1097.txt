**Abstract**  
This study investigates how prior usage experience with various decision aids
available in an Internet shopping environment contributes to online purchase
behavior evolution. Four types of decision aids are examined: those for (1)
nutritional needs, (2) brand preference, (3) economic needs, and (4)
personalized shopping lists. We construct and estimate nonhomogeneous hidden
Markov models of store- and category-level purchase decisions, in which
parameters vary over time across hidden states as driven by usage experience
with different decision aids. We find that consumers evolve through distinct
behavioral states over time, and the evolution is attributable to their prior
usage experience with various decision aids. Moreover, the impact varies by
the specific decision aid, behavioral state, and category characteristics. In
addition, consumers gravitate toward habitual decision processes in online
grocery stores, and their average price and promotion sensitivities increase
first and then decrease but the level of heterogeneity rises continuously. We
identify beneficial versus potentially undesirable decision aids and
demonstrate how the proposed research method can help online retailers improve
their store environments, design customized promotions, and quantify the
payoffs of these strategies.
