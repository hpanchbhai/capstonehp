## New Leadership Named to AACSB International's Board of Directors

The world's largest business education alliance announces Caryn Beck-Dudley of
the Leavey School of Business as its newest chair of the board of directors.

TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/—Business law, ethics, and
entrepreneurship expert [Caryn L. Beck-Dudley](http://www.aacsb.edu/about/who-
we-are/board-of-directors/caryn-beck-dudley), dean of the [Leavey School of
Business](https://youtu.be/MlfIoPZhxIc) at Santa Clara University, has assumed
the role as chair of the board of directors of [AACSB
International](http://www.aacsb.edu/)—The Association to Advance Collegiate
Schools of Business (AACSB), effective January 31, 2018.

"I am thrilled to take on this new responsibility. Sitting in the heart of
Silicon Valley brings an innovative and entrepreneurial perspective to all we
do," said Beck-Dudley. "I look forward to working with my fellow deans and
sharing insights as we face the challenges and opportunities of leading
business schools during this disruptive time."

Elected to the AACSB board in 2008 as a member, and as vice chair-chair elect
in 2017, Beck-Dudley's volunteer work with the association spans nearly 15
years of dedicated service. Throughout this time, her insight and expertise in
the fields of law, ethics, and entrepreneurship have helped to guide more than
12 volunteer working groups or committees.

Additionally, Beck-Dudley has played an active role in the AACSB accreditation
process by serving as a member and/or chair of more than 20 peer-review teams,
and a member and/or chair of the Special Committee on Global Accreditation
Strategy, the Continuous Improvement Review Committee, the Committee on
Accreditation Policy, and the Accreditation Coordination Committee. Further,
Beck-Dudley has served as a strong voice, and mentor, within AACSB's Women
Administrators in Management Education Affinity Group.

"Digital technologies are changing the knowledge and skill-sets needed in
graduates, and as such, are reshaping the talent and education market," said
Thomas R. Robinson, president and chief executive officer of AACSB
International. "As the business education industry identifies how it can grow
and pivot to meet these demands, Caryn's passion for innovation and her
insight into the entrepreneurial approach will bring an important layer of
knowledge to the Board. We look forward to her guidance over the course of her
term as AACSB's chair."

Beck-Dudley graduated magna cum laude from Utah State University in political
science. She received her JD from the University of Idaho College of Law,
where she was on the moot court team and the editorial board for the Idaho Law
Review. She is also a member of the Academy of Legal Studies in Business,
serving as past chair.

Alongside Beck-Dudley, the following two prominent business education leaders
have begun their roles as vice chair-chair elect and secretary-treasurer on
the AACSB board.

"We are also pleased to welcome John as vice chair-chair elect, and Enase as

experiences which demonstrate both the value and strengths found within the
AACSB board. We look forward to their continued service and leadership in the
years to come."
