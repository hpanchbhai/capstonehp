## Alexander J. Field

#### Michel and Mary Orradre Professor of Economics

__[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](/media/leavey-school-of-business/economics/Field-CV-
Sept-2018.pdf)

* * *

Over the past two decades, Professor Field's research has been in two main
areas. The first, aimed at better integrating the human sciences, is reflected
in his 2001 book, Altruistically Inclined? The Behavioral Sciences,
Evolutionary Theory, and the Origins of Reciprocity, which won the 2003 Alpha
Sigma Nu National Book Award in the Social Sciences. Subsequent contributions
in this area include "Group Selection and Behavioral Economics," in the
Handbook of Contemporary Behavioral Economics: Foundations and Developments
(2006), "Beyond Foraging", which appeared in the December 2007 Journal of
Institutional Economics, and "Why Multilevel Selection Matters", in the
Journal of Bioeconomics (December 2008). More recently, his paper
"Prosociality and the Military" appeared in the Journal of Bioeconomics (July
2014), and "Schelling, von Neumann, and the Event that didn't Occur" was
published in Games (2014).

A second area of research has been in macroeconomic history with a focus on
technology and productivity. His article "The Most Technologically Progressive
Decade of the Twentieth Century" appeared in the September 2003 American
Economic Review. Other articles in this area include "Technological Change and
U.S. Economic Growth in the Interwar Years," Journal of Economic History
(March 2006), "Technical Change and U.S. Economic Growth: The Interwar Period
and the 1990s" in Paul Rhode and Gianni Toniolo, eds. The Global Economy in
the 1990s: A Long Run Perspective (2006), "The Equipment Hypothesis and U.S.
Economic Growth," Explorations in Economic History (January 2007), "The
Origins of U.S. Total Factor Productivity Growth in the Golden Age,"
Cliometrica (April 2007), "The Impact of the Second World War on U.S.
Productivity Growth" Economic History Review (2008) and "U.S. Economic Growth
in the Gilded Age," Journal of Macroeconomics (March 2009). His book A Great
Leap Forward: 1930s Depression and US Economic Growth, published by Yale
University Press, was selected as a 2011 Choice Outstanding Academic Title in
the Economics category. In 2012 it received the Alice Hanson Jones Biennial
Book Award as well as the 2012 Alpha Sigma Nu National Book Award in Social
Sciences.

His most recent working paper “The Impact of the Second World War on the
Growth of US potential Output” continues the exploration of the impact of
World War II on the US economy. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, Field
argues that the learning by doing associated with the mass production of
276,000 aircraft in a four year period as well as other ordnance, was largely
irrelevant after the war because these were unique, never to be repeated
events. Combined with the loss of manpower, the immediate postwar decline in
female labor force participation, and the disruptive effects of war
mobilization and demobilization, he concludes that, on net, the economic
effects of the conflict were almost certainly retardative.

Other recent publications include a review essay on Thomas Piketty's best
seller, Capital in the Twenty First Century in the Journal of Economic History
(September 2014), "The Savings and Loan Insolvencies and the Cost of Financial
Crisis (Research in Economic History, 2017), "Ideology, Economic Policy and
Economic History: Cohen and DeLong's Concrete Economics (Journal of Economic
Literature, December 2017, and “Manufacturing Productivity and U.S. Economic
Growth” in the Oxford Handbook of American Economic History (2018). His paper
on “Historical Measures of Economic Output” is forthcoming in the Handbook of
Cliometrics.

Professor Field edited Research in Economic History for over ten years, and
served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Economic History and
Explorations in Economic History, and for over twenty years as Associate
Editor of the Journal of Economic Literature. He was Executive Director of the
Economic History Association between 2004 and 2012, on the National Science
Foundation's Economics Panel in 2005 and 2006, and is currently on the
Advisory Board of Cliometrica and the Journal of Bioeconomics. During the
academic year 2013-14, he participated in the Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholars
Program.

Prior to coming to Santa Clara, Professor Field taught at Stanford University.
At Santa Clara University he has served as acting Academic Vice President
(1986-87), on the University's Board of Trustees (1988-91), as Associate and
Acting Dean of the Leavey School of Business between 1993 and 1997, and as
chair of the Economics Department between 1988 and 1993, and again in 2013-14.
