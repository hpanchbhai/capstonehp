Helpful Information for International Applicants

You may have questions about graduate business study in the U.S. and this
section and our FAQs may help you. If you need additional information, we
welcome your email ([gradbusiness@scu.edu](mailto:gradbusiness@scu.edu)).

###### In addition to submitting general application materials, international
students should be aware of the requirements below.

###### TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)

Applicants whose first language is not English (regardless of whether your
schooling was in English) must take the **TOEFL** (Test of English as a
Foreign Language) and have ETS send the scores directly to Santa Clara
University, Institution Code 4851. A minimum TOEFL score of 100 on the IBT
test. We also accept the IELTS. A minimum score of 7.0 is required.  The TOEFL
may be waived if the applicant receives a score in the 50th percentile or
higher on the verbal portion of the GMAT/GRE or have obtained a U.S. degree
from an accredited institution. You should confirm your eligibility for a
waiver with the Graduate Business Admissions office.

###### Visas

Foreign-born applicants requesting student visas (F-1) must be accepted and
have placed a deposit in order to process an I-20. F-1 applicants must be
enrolled in at least eight (8) units per quarter. See the University's website
for international students for more information regarding student visas.

Once accepted to the Leavey School of Business, you need to complete the I-20
Request Form and the Financial Resource Statement and include official
documents verifying funds to cover tuition, fees and living expenses for the
first year of the two-year MBA program. These documents cannot be more than 90
days old.

NOTE:  ** _International students who are studying on the F-1 visa are not
eligible for the Executive MBA program._**

###### Financial Aid

Federal financial aid is not available for non-US citizens, except in cases
where they have attained Permanent Resident status and have made application
for citizenship. International students are considered for merit based
scholarships at the time of admission. For more information, please contact
the Graduate Business Admissions and Financial Aid, Leavey School of Business,
408-554-4539.

###### U.S. Employment for Foreign Students

To learn more about employment opportunities for international students on- or
off-campus, please visit the [International Student Services website
here](/global/international-students/ "Home » Home » Global » International
Students") »

######  

##### How do I get my degree evaluated?

__

SCU requires a WES ICAP (World Education Services International Credential
Advantage Package) evaluation for international degrees. For more information,
see [WES](https://www.wes.org/).

##### As an applicant who would need an F1 Student Visa to study in the U.S.,
which programs are full-time?

__

International applicants, those needing a student visa to study in the
program, are eligible to apply for our Evening MBA and all MS programs. Due to
the specialized nature of our Executive MBA program, F-1 visa holders are not
eligible for admission. (H1 and H4 visa holders and permanent residents are
eligible for these programs.)

##### Is it possible to receive conditional admission before taking the GMAT
or GRE?

__

No. All required application materials must be received by the Admissions
Office in order for an admissions decision to be made.

##### I have little work experience. Am I eligible for any of Santa Clara's
MBA programs?

__

Exceptionally qualified international students with fewer than three years of
professional work experience are eligible to apply to our Evening MBA program.

##### I have a three-year degree; am I eligible to apply?

__

Have your degree evaluated by [World Education Services
(WES)](https://www.wes.org/). If your degree is evaluated as a Bachelor's
Degree, we will accept it.

##### Do I need to take the TOEFL?

__

The TOEFL may be waived only if the applicant receives a score in the 50th
percentile or higher on the verbal portion of the GMAT or GRE. Applicants
whose GMAT/GRE score was lower than the 50th percentile, and whose native
language is not English (regardless of whether your schooling was in English)
must take the [TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign
Language)](http://www.toefl.org) and have ETS send the scores directly to
**Santa Clara University, Institution Code 4851, Department 02**. A minimum
TOEFL of 100 on the IBT test  is required. Applications with a degree from an
accredited U.S. university are waived from the TOEFL requirement.

##### Santa Clara University's MBA is a part-time program. Can I still enroll?

__

Yes. Our MBA program is considered flexible; therefore, it is possible for
students to enroll in either a part-time or full-time equivalent course-load.

_**International students are required to enroll in at least 8 quarter units
each term.** _ Enrolling in 8 units per term, including summer term, you will
finish your MBA in approximately two years. (Note: summer term is optional).
