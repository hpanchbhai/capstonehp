## Wendy Donohoe

#### Professor of Practice, Accounting

* * *

Wendy Donohoe studied accounting and earned her M.B.A. from Santa Clara
University in 1978 and her M.S. in Taxation from Golden Gate University in
1988.

Ms. Donohoe's career began at Intel as an Internal Auditor, moved into public
accounting with Deloitte & Touche’s Audit Department and onto KPMG in their
Tax Department. In 1984, her combined experience culminated in a position as
Chief Financial Officer for a large regional family owned business. During her
tenure in that position, Ms. Donohoe worked with family owners wanting to pave
the way to retirement. She assisted in the implementation of a successful
business and estate plan that transitioned corporate revenue from active
operations to real estate rental activities.

Ms. Donohoe has been actively licensed in the state of California since 1981,
maintains her license as active to date, and is a member of the AICPA.

Ms. Donohoe has been a lecturer at Santa Clara University since 1998 and has
taught both Auditing and Taxation in addition to her mainstay course load in
Managerial Accounting and Personal Financial Planning. She also works with
students as a University Advisor for the Drahmann Advising and Learning
Resources Center. For Wendy, the journey in accounting that began at Santa
Clara University has come full circle. “I am richly blessed,” says Ms. Donohoe
of her entire experience here at SCU and in the accounting profession.
