#### **Beta Gamma Sigma**

![Beta Gamma Sigma is business education's honor society](/media/leavey-
school-of-business/undergraduates/bgs-centen-350-200x200.jpg)

Beta Gamma Sigma, the national business honor society, was founded in 1913,
and is the business academy's equivalent of the humanities' Phi Beta Kappa.
The Santa Clara University chapter was begun in 1955.

The mission of Beta Gamma Sigma is to encourage and honor academic achievement
in the study of business and personal and professional excellence. Membership
is offered to students who show promise of success in the field of business
and rank in the top seven percent of their junior class or in the top 10
percent of their senior class.

####  

#### **Leavey Scholars**

Business sophomores who have maintained a cumulative SCU GPA in the top 10 to
15% of their class through the end of the spring quarter of their first year
(usually a minimum of GPA of 3.7 or better) are invited to become Leavey
Scholars.

Leavey Scholars enjoy benefits such as:

  * Special 'honors' sections offered only to similiarly motivated students
  * Early registration
  * Upon completion of the program, the desgination "Leavey Scholar" on the transcript

![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/undergraduates/leavey-scholars-
program/Student-Group-Photo-Dinner-2018-250x250.jpg)

To complete the Leavey Scholars Program, students complete at least three
upper-division scholars sections or two upper-division scholars sections and
one of the two lower-division honors course, followed by the scholars section
of Capstone.
