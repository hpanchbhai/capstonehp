Leopoldo Magana

#### 2017-2018 Fellow,  
Office of San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo

Operations Management & Information Systems Major  
Home Town:  Los Angeles, CA

**Leo's final thoughts on his internship:**   **My favorite part of this
experience has been the people that I have had the opportunity to work with.
The decisions made by the people working here have an extensive reach as they
impact the city as a whole. The employees know this and work hard to
understand what issues are affecting the public so that they can better serve
their needs. I had never considered a career in government, but after working
with such a passionate group of people I can see myself choosing to go this
route someday.**
