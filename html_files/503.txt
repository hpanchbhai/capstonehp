## Business Faculty Recognized as Top Teaching Scholars in 2018

Business faculty were honored for outstanding contributions in teaching,
research, and service.

Faculty honored for outstanding contributions in teaching, research, and
service.

With the new school year right around the corner, Santa Clara University took
one more opportunity to look back on the 2017–18 academic year. On September
11, President **Michael Engh, S.J.**  and Provost **Dennis C. Jacobs**
celebrated the achievements of  Santa Clara’s faculty with an award ceremony
on campus. Here are this year’s Leavey School of Business winners.

## Award for Sustained Excellence in Scholarship

### Yongtae Kim, Accounting

**[Yongtae Kim](https://www.scu.edu/business/accounting/faculty/kim/)**
received the University’s highest award for scholarly achievement for his
dedicated and prolific scholarship on important issues in accounting and
finance.

![Yongtae Kim](/media/institutional-pages/news-ampamp-events/yongtaekim.jpg)

Yongtae Kim

His research ranges from earnings management and voluntary disclosure to
corporate social responsibility, equity offerings, auditing, and venture
capital. In particular, his work regarding opportunistic financial reporting
behavior has contributed to both academic literature and practice, helping
regulators better understand the motives of firms engaging in earnings
management.

Kim has presented around the world—from Canada to China, the Czech Republic to
Hong Kong—while authoring more than 25 articles. He was a two-time Moskowitz
Research Prize honorable mention, as well as a two-time Hong Kong Government
General Research Grant and four-time PwC research grant recipient. Kim’s
scholarship is not just impactful, but aligns with the mission of Santa Clara:
displaying that socially responsible firms also behave in a responsible
manner, delivering more transparent and reliable financial information to
investors.



## Award for Recent Achievement in Scholarship

### George Cai, Information Systems and Analytics

Through his scholarly and creative work, **[George
Cai](https://www.scu.edu/business/isa/faculty/cai/)**  has offered a major
contribution to the fields of operations management, marketing interface, and
supply chain finance during the past five years.

events/cai-534-360x283.jpg)

George Cai

Since joining SCU in 2012, Cai has published more than 12 refereed journal
papers—five in top tier journals. His growing reputation has led to
invitations to be both an associate editor for a premier field publication in
2013 and a senior editor for another top level journal in 2015.

Cai has won multiple scholarly awards, such as the Shanghai Outstanding Paper
Award in social sciences and the Outstanding Associate Editor Award of
Decision Sciences Journal. He was ranked No. 4 on the list of the most
prominent retailing authors worldwide between 2009 and 2015 by Emerald
Publishing. His external research grants have totaled more than $1 million, a
very rare achievement for business faculty.



## Presidential Special Recognition Award

practices on behalf of lecturers and adjunct faculty at Santa Clara for many
