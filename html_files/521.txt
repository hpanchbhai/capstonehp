teacher. He had a Bachelor's in Human Development and Master's in Elementary
Education. The CAAP Program prepared Jeremy for public accounting despite not
having any background in accounting prior to admission. Jeremy is currently
working at BDO as a Assurance Associate. He enjoys public accounting because
it allows him to still be involved in sectors he is passionate about such as
the healthcare industry.

(recruiting events, lunch seminars, and experienced faculty), Katy was able to
learn about the public accounting industry and connect with firms. Katy is now
working as an Assurance Senior at BDO and has the flexibility to still be able
