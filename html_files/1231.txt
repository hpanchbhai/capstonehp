### Joel Ching Named 2010 Outstanding Student Entrepreneur

and Dan Aguiar, Executive Director of Entrepreneurship Programs  

Congratulations to 2010 Outstanding Student Entrepreneur Joel Ching!  This
honor is awarded by the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship to a
graduating student enrolled in the Undergraduate Entrepreneurship Program in
recognition of significant achievements in the program, acknowledgment of
accomplishments in entrepreneurship and the promise of future success.  

An exemplary model of the entrepreneurial spirit, Joel has been a standout
student with his own startup, Koa Notes, his participation in multiple
business plan and elevator pitch competitions, and his contributions to both
the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship and the undergraduate student
entrepreneurship club the SCEO.

OahuCBS-2009-300x271_1-300x271.jpg)  

Joel recently served as the Director of the Oahu Camp BizSmart, a two-week
innovative entrepreneurial and leadership academy where students age 11-15
learn to compete in a global economy with the core values of teaching business
and entrepreneurial skills grounded in character, courage and citizenship. The
CIE is a proud sponsor of the Santa Clara Camp Biz Smart to be held on campus
in August.  

Camp BizSmart founders Dr. Michael Gibbs and Peggy Gibbs first met Joel when
Camp BizSmart was barely a year old, as they were recruiting bright, curious
and smart Santa Clara business students to help them grow. Knowing he was from
Hawaii, they immediately began thinking of running a camp on Oahu, and Joel
said: "sure, why not".   He did an outstanding job, inspiring a small, eager
band of "tweenpreneurs" on the island of Oahu to come up with some really cool
ideas, which the students pitched live to Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.

In addition to being on board for a second year of directing the Hawaii Camp
BizSmart, Joel will spend a year in Japan to teach English through the Japan
Exchange and Teaching Porgramme (JET Programme) before returning to the Santa
Clara area.

He has been an ambassador of the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship
and a true role model for students in the program. Joel will receive this
award at the Leavey School of Business Senior Awards Ceremony on June 11 with
a presentation by Dr. Michael Gibbs.  He was awarded a separate certificate at
the June CIE Advisory Board meeting.

Congratulations!
