**_NEW GPS: Global Equity Plans_**

![ Global Equity Plans Thumbnail.pdf](/media/leavey-school-of-
business/cepi/gps/Global-Equity-Plans-Thumbnail.png)

The latest addition to the GPS Library is GPS: Global Equity Plans. This
publication was originally titled “Global Stock Plans” and was released in
2009. Since that time, the use of global equity plans has become much more
common, as companies are operating in multiple countries. Emphasis has been
given to areas of risk that are independent of a specific country. Country
specific information is provided through links to information available on the
internet, ensuring the information is updated The title has also been updated
to reflect the use of all types of equity awards (not just stock plans.).

![CEPI2016_stockoptions_thumb.png](/media/leavey-school-of-
business/cepi/gps/CEPI2016_stockoptions_thumb-148x185.png)

GPS| Stock Options was originally titled  “Non-Qualified Stock Options” and
was released in 2007. Completely updated in 2016, this publication now focuses
on both non-qualified (NSO) and incentive (ISO) stock options awarded to U.S.
employees of U.S. domiciled, publicly traded companies with time based
vesting.  It provides a detailed assessment of critical financial, legal, and
operational risks for many key processes of the equity compensation
department. For each process, illustrative controls and tests of controls to
mitigate the risk have been identified. The publication was also updated to
reflect that most companies utilize a relatively automated administration
infrastructure defined as a hosted software platform (Saas) and partial or
full outsourcing. The controls and tests of those controls have been updated
to reflect this automation.
