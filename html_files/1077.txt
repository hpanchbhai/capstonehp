## The Moderating Effect of Relative Performance Evaluation on the Risk
Incentive Properties of Executives' Equity Portfolios

Hyungshin Park, Dimitris Vrettos

Journal of Accounting Research

_Journal of Accounting Research_

Abstract:

We offer evidence that the use of relative performance evaluation (RPE) in
CEOs’ incentive contracts influences the effect of risk-taking incentives on
both the magnitude and composition of firm risk. We find that, when the
incentive design lacks RPE features, the incentive portfolio vega motivates
CEOs to increase total risk through the systematic component because it can be
hedged. In contrast, when the incentive design includes RPE features, CEOs
prefer idiosyncratic risk because RPE filters out the systematic component of
firm performance. We also document that the use of RPE reinforces the
incentive portfolio vega's effect on the total risk.
