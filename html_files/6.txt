**The Association for Advancement of Collegiate Schools of Business** ([AACSB
International](http://www.aacsb.edu/)) awarded accreditation to the Leavey
School of Business in 1953, one of the first professional schools of business
to be awarded this recognition.

accreditation/Accredidation.jpg)

accredited-color-RGB-200x68.png)

The MBA program was recognized with accreditation in 1959, the first-year
graduate business students were enrolled at Santa Clara University. The
Executive MBA program was accredited in 1999, the year students were enrolled
there, and the Accelerated MBA program received recognition in the year of its
inception, 2007.

Our four MS programs as well as our undergraduate business programs fall under
the Leavey School’s general accreditation by AACSB.

The Accounting Department earned separate accreditation from AACSB
International in 1996, and is one of only five collegiate accounting
departments in California to be so recognized.
