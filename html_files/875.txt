## Local Volatility and the Recovery Rate of Credit Default Swaps

Sanjiv Das

##### Jeroen Jansena, Sanjiv Dasb, and Frank J. Fabozzi

Forthcoming, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control.

Abstract:

Credit default swap (CDS) spreads can only be decomposed into the probability
of default and the loss-given-default by imposing some structure. Employinga
hybrid binomial tree for equities and a recovery function, Das and Hanouna
(2009)obtainaccurate estimates for CDS spreadsby fitting the model to
historical equity volatilities. We extend their approach by including the full
implied volatility surface,developingan implied binomial tree with a jump to
default based on extending the Derman and Kani (1994)tree. We then evaluate
the effect of including the full volatility surface on the implied CDS
recovery rate.
