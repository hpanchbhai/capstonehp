Jackie Schmidt-Posner, Ph.D.

#### Program Director

Jackie Schmidt-Posner is an educator who has spent her career helping students
make connections between their commitments to community engagement and social
justice and their academic, personal and career development. Jackie started
her educational career at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
majoring in political science and sociology. At UCSB, she chaired the
Community Affairs Board and started and co-led a Brownie troop for girls in
underserved areas of Santa Barbara.

She received a master's degree in college student development from the Ohio
State University.  After working with returning adult students at the
University of Massachusetts Amherst for four years, she came to Santa Clara
University as a career counselor and founding director of the Women’s Center
at Santa Clara University.  Jackie then returned to school, earning a Ph.D. in
Educational Policy from Stanford University.

While at Stanford, she found her true passion when she began working as a
graduate research assistant at the Public Service Center, which became the
Haas Center for Public Service. She never looked back and spent a fulfilling
22 years with the center. Initially, she was responsible for evaluation and
then moved into building the infrastructure for student development, group
advising and leadership programs. She directed the Public Service Scholars
program and served as associate director and interim executive director before
leaving the center in June 2009 to spend a sabbatical year traveling and
working internationally.

Jackie returned to Santa Clara University, as a Professor of Practice in the
Leavey School of Business in 2010, to work with Dean Drew Starbird on
developing a program for undergraduate business majors to contribute to the
local community.  This became the Neighborhood Prosperity Initiative—the BUSN
188 course and the LSB Community Fellows program.  She continues to teach and
supervise Community Fellows,  In addition her work at SCU, Jackie serves on
the boards of two non-profit organizations – Tandem Partners in early Learning
(Board Chair), and VIA (Volunteers in Asia).
