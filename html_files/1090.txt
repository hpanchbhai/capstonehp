## Catalyst organizations as a new organization design for innovation: The
case of hyperloop transportation technologies

Abstract:

The crucial contingencies surrounding organization design for innovation are
experiencing drastic shifts. First, environmental uncertainty is rising with
the increasingly connected nature of innovation. Second, the internet provides
an almost costless supply of external knowledge. Current organization design
theory does not provide adequate frames for studying organizations attempting
to simultaneously leverage shifts of uncertainty and the costless supply of
external knowledge. In the process of qualitatively examining one such
organization – the crowd-based Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, Inc.
(HTT) – we find that HTT’s design does not fit existing design schema. We
label this new design form a “catalyst” organization, clarifying how HTT’s
design challenges existing organization design principles while simultaneously
showing researchers a way forward to new theorizing. We derive implications
for theories of organization design, exploration, and online knowledge-
creating communities.
