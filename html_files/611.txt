###### _"If I were to take anything away from working at San Jose's City Hall,
it's that the issues of homelessness and poverty in the Silicon Valley are
complex, far-reaching and systematic. There are no quick-fixes. But, there is
a light at the end of the tunnel. Change requires the empowerment of local
leadership, whether that be through a neighborhood, a community association, a
school, or a small business. Particularly with small businesses, city
governments have the ability to promote growth and lower barriers to entry;
small businesses make strong and invested communities. I am excited to see
continued strengthening of micro-communities within San Jose and watch them
contribute to the betterment of the city.  "_
