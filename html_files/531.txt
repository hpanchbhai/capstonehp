Welcome Drake Bonin, Program Manager

Although Drake is new to the CEP Institute team, he is not new to Santa Clara
University. Drake graduated from the University in 2015 with degrees in both
English and Spanish Language & Literature. After graduating, Drake worked at
the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts as the
Membership Data & Elections Coordinator. In that role, he oversaw the
membership application process for all new nominees, culminating in the
induction of the 2016 Academy class of members. Prior to his current role,
Drake worked as the Admissions Officer for Stanford Law School. While there,
he oversaw two admission cycles, welcoming in the classes of 2020 and 2021.
Drake will be working with the Director of the CEP Institute, Alex Florea,
where he will use his background in Higher Education administration to assist
with the overall growth of the CEP Institute.

Please join us in welcoming Drake.

Featured CEP: Amanda Benincasa



![Amanda Benincasa, CEP](/media/leavey-school-of-business/cepi/Headshot.jpg)

Amanda Benincasa is an Associate Director with Aon’s Global Technical Shared
Services Team. She joined Aon in 2016 and moved from Senior Consultant to
Associate Director within the Aon Equity Services team in early 2018. Her
background consists of both consulting and technical accounting for equity,
handling topics including employee stock options, restricted stock units,
performance share awards, restricted stock awards, repurchases, IPOs, and an
array of SEC reporting responsibilities (10Q/K, Proxy, Forms 4/5, etc.). She
is an industry speaker, addressing topics related to equity valuation and
accounting, and has written several articles surrounding the same topics. She
serves on the Board of Directors of the NASPP Western PA Chapter. Amanda
earned her CEP in June 2018.

"I think receiving the CEP designation confirmed my role on my team and my
expertise in the industry, and also forced me a little out of my comfort zone
of technical accounting. With the designation, I feel that my knowledge of
administration and governance, in particular, has increased significantly and
made me much more comfortable discuss complex and strategic issues within
equity compensation."

Amanda's advice to November CEP Candidates: "Take advantage of the people in
our industry. I’ve worked in other industries and can say wholeheartedly that
the camaraderie in this industry is a rarity. I cannot explain how many peers,
clients, service providers, and even competitors in our space have gone above
and beyond to explain complex concepts or even sometimes really simple
concepts. We work in a tight-knit community where people should really be
leaning on those around them and absorbing everything they can from the
subject matter experts they have access to. Take advantage of the study
groups, take advantage of your Linked In connections, and remember that you
are the subject matter expert!"

##### Continuing Education



![Illustration of a Calendar](/media/leavey-school-of-
business/cepi/Calendar-v3-150x145.jpg)

To protect and enhance the reputation of the CEP designation, designees are
required to complete and report 30 hours of industry-related continuing
education every two years in order to continue using the CEP designation. If
you need to know when your CE is due, please log into your MyCEP account. Note
that with the update of the MyCEP system, there are some changes to our
Continuing Education reporting. We will no longer be offering extensions on
Continuing Education applications, so please be sure to submit your
applications on time. The grace period is extended until March 31, to give you
a little extra time. If you have any questions about Continuing Education,
please visit our . For a list of continuing education opportunities, please
see our  on our website.

##### Representing the CEP Designation



![CEP Badge](/media/leavey-school-of-business/cepi/SM-CEP-Badge.png)

The CEPI encourages people to highlight their participation in the CEP Program
in their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, on name badges at conferences, in bios
when speaking at industry events, in membership directories, etc.  The CEPI
has worked hard for many years to build the credibility of the CEP mark and we
appreciate it being used appropriately.  The CEPI has some guidelines on how
to include your participation in the program.

For CEPs: Please highlight your important achievement by using the CEP mark
(CEP preceded by a comma) following your first and last name.  You may also
list your certification in your resume or bio.  On your LinkedIn profile,
please list your designation under the Education section with a link to the
Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University.  You may also list your
designation under Certificates and specify the date you received your
certification.

For candidates who have completed Level One or Level Two: Until a candidate
has passed all three levels of the program, the candidate may describe their
accomplishment in their professional biography, resume or LinkedIn profile
(under Education section) as "Jane Doe has completed Level 1 [or Level 2] of
the CEP program through the Certified Equity Professional Institute at Santa
Clara University."  You may use the link to the Leavey School of Business at
Santa Clara University.
