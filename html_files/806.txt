Urban Agriculture

#### **Urban Agriculture in Silicon Valley**

Our research focuses on providing high-quality information that can help to
make the local food system more sustainable, healthy, and fair. We are
particularly concerned with how urban agriculture—or the production,
distribution, and exchange of food in cities and at their edges—can contribute
to greater food security and improved access to healthy foods for underserved
communities. Working with local partners, we also explore obstacles to urban
agriculture, relevant policies, and innovative models for agriculture and food
access in this heavily urbanized region.

**[Food Gardening in Santa Clara County](/media/leavey-school-of-
business/cfie/5-4-16-Final-Garden-Report.pdf): Preliminary Results **

This report summarizes the results of a garden harvest study, in which 86
volunteers weighed what they harvested from their gardens, and a survey of
more than 400 Santa Clara County food gardeners in 2015.  Our preliminary
results show that gardeners from diverse backgrounds are producing food that
contributes to household consumption of nutritious and culturally important
vegetables.
