# Beyond the Classroom

  4. Beyond the Classroom 

A sense of community is key, both within the group and with Santa Clara
University as a whole.

Because of this, the ISA department offers ways for students to actively
participate in their community, both on an undergraduate and graduate level.

![OMIS Student Network \(OSN\) image cap](/media/leavey-school-of-
business/isa/OMIS-Student-Network-Bannerv2-360x200.jpg)

#### OMIS Student Network (OSN)

The OSN is a member-driven organization. Without active participation, the
expected benefits of joining the OSN are minimal. It is important for students
to engage themselves in their major and to gain as much knowledge about the
industry before stepping into their chosen careers. The success of the OSN is
dependent upon both the students and the officers of the OSN.
