## Kimmy Barclay: SVCN Hosts 7th Annual Health and Housing Summit

Kimmy recaps her experience working on the 7th Annual SVCN Health and Housing
Summit

fellows/lsb-fellows-blog-360x240.png)

Over the past few weeks, Silicon Valley Council of Nonprofits has been working
tirelessly in preparation for the seventh annual Health and Housing Summit.
This event brings together our member non-profits, local and state
representatives, and other leaders in the areas of health services and
housing. Panels and discussions are facilitated in an effort to address the
concerns of those in direct contact with our community, as well as, provide an
opportunity for our non-profits to learn from each other so they can prepare
for what lies ahead of them.

This past Friday, February 2, the Health and Housing Summit welcomed over 180
attendees, its biggest turnout to date. Among those in attendance were
California Senate President pro Tempore, Kevin De Leon, Santa Clara County
Supervisor, Mike Wasserman, and California State Assembly member, Ash Kalra.
These government representatives were part of a panel that allowed our
community leaders to ask questions regarding what our government is doing to
address issues such as rising housing costs and the anticipated cut to
healthcare funding in Washington. Two more panels also ensued which focused
more heavily on healthcare concerns and how our nonprofits can more
effectively accomplish their goals.

One hot topic at the summit surrounded the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Under
this recent tax reform, charitable tax deductions will become much less common
due to the increased standard deduction and stricter rules regarding what can
go towards that deduction. Obviously, this is a pertinent piece of legislation
for SVCN and its members since it will affect their already-limited funding.
At the summit, California Senate President pro Tempore, Kevin De Leon,
discussed his senate bill which would help counteract the effects of the TCJA.
Essentially, it would create a fund that people could donate to in exchange
for a tax credit. This workaround would help re-establish the incentive for
taxpayers to use some of their discretionary income to help fund the important
work that nonprofits do.

As the event came to an end, nearly everyone gave SVCN praise for an extremely
successful event. Personally, it was great for me to hear some of the
questions the members asked because it gave me an idea as to what their most
pressing concerns are. Also, hearing what our government representatives had
to say about what they were doing to address community concerns and what
members could do to further those efforts showed how important collaboration
and communication between these two groups are. That is why I think this event
is such a success for SVCN and I’m sure it will continue to draw larger and
larger crowds.
