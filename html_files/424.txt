## New MBA Alumni Advisory Board

SCU's Leavey School of Business announces the formation of a new advisory
board to expand a connection with MBA alumni and corporate engagement.

**SANTA CLARA, Calif.** February 4, 2019—The Leavey School of Business at
Santa Clara University announces the formation of a new advisory board to
provide a  connection back to Masters in Business Administration alumni and
corporate engagement.

The Leavey School of Business is proud to announce the creation of the new MBA
Alumni Advisory Board that will focus on key strategic initiatives for our top
ranked MBA Program.  Created to help support the continued enhancement of the
MBA Program, the board, which will be managed by Dr. Nydia MacGregor, MBA
Faculty Director, and Dr. Toby McChesney, Sr. Assistant Dean of Graduate
Business Programs, will focus on student engagement, corporate connections and
curriculum updates that are essential components to drive the program to new
heights.  

“There is nothing more vital to our MBA programs than maintaining relevance
and delivering the highest impact courses for our students,” said Dr.
MacGregor. “That's why I'm so enthusiastic about the launch of our new MBA
Advisory Board. They are an incredibly talented group with a variety of
experiences and backgrounds. Their insights and passion will ensure that our
curriculum, concentrations, and career development remain forward-looking,
rigorous, and competitive while staying aligned with our mission.”  

The new members - Fiona Geisinger, A. Niki Saxena, Erin Horiuchi, Andrew
Leung, Quyen Change, Amr Darwish and Gwendoline Tuma - began their tenure on
February 1st, 2019. As the program progresses and engages, the number of board
members will grow.  

“Our MBA Program is already a top notch program and this will continue to
heighten our exposure in the market and engage with our alums,” says Dr.
McChesney, “There are few Evening MBA alumni boards in the country and we are
proud to be a first mover.”
