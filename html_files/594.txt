Bannerv2-1-360x200.jpg)

Santa Clara University's OMIS Student Network (OSN), housed in the Information
Systems and Analytics department, is geared towards undergraduate Management
Information Systems majors and minors, Accounting Information Systems majors,
as well as Business Analytics minors.

OSN provides the tools and resources necessary for students to grow their
skills technically, professionally and personally and aims to bring students
together for networking, social and career opportunities.

Message from the President:

Whether you are a business student interested in technology or a technical
student interested in business, we are the club for you! Throughout the year,
we will host information sessions and workshops with consulting and technology
firms in the bay area, and provide you with the opportunity to grow your
skills and network with industry professionals. Also save the date for
BroncoHack, our annual hackathon coming up in April.



I look forward to meeting you at our events!



Yueqi Su

President, OMIS Student Network
