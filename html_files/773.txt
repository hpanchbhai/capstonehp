#### Marilyn J. Perkins Claassen  
Memorial Scholarship Program  

The Marilyn J. Perkins Claassen Memorial Scholarship is to be awarded each
year to two members of the stock plan community who wish to pursue the
Certified Equity Professional (CEP) designation through the Santa Clara
University CEP Institute (CEPI).

The original Marilyn J. Perkins Claassen Scholarship was funded by the
Certified Equity Professional Institute. From 2009 - 2011,
[OptionEase](https://solium.com/) sponsored a second scholarship. In 2012, the
CEPI welcomed [OPTRACK](http://www.optrack.net/) as a sponsor to further
expand the program.

In 2016, Optrack was acquired by
[Computershare](http://www.computershare.com/us "Computersharelink"). We are
pleased to have the continued support of the Marilyn J. Perkins Claasen
Memorial Scholarship, now sponsored by Computershare.

The successful applicant will be provided with a full scholarship for all
three levels, excluding exam materials. The recipient will be required to take
all three exams within five test cycles; the scholarship will expire at the
end of five test cycles. If a scholarship recipient has already completed one
or more levels of the CEP program, the scholarship will cover the costs of the
remaining levels, excluding materials, to be completed within four test
cycles.
