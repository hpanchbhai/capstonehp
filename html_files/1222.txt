## Tiffany Vu: Communication and Proactivity is Key

Tiffany discusses the lessons she learned at the Hispanic Foundation of
Silicon Valley.

Throughout my fellowship at the Hispanic Foundation of Silicon Valley, I’ve
had the chance to learn a variety of lessons. First, is the importance of good
communication. For the Family College Success Center (FCSC) in particular,
there is always a lot of running around that needs to be done with multiple
events happening at the same time. When I first started the internship, I had
no idea where I was going, what I was going to, and what I had to bring with
me. Now, however, with all the guidance I have had throughout the internship,
it is almost second nature to me to be aware of what is happening and where I
am needed. Utilizing good communication, I was able to develop a better
understanding of what is expected of me and what I can do to help out. Knowing
the importance of communication, I know that after I graduate from SCU I’m
going to have to really explain to my future employers what I expect from them
and what they should expect from me.

Another important lesson that I have learned from my fellowship is that my
voice and opinions matter. Although I was “just the intern,” there are ideas
and knowledge that I possess that can help the organization. One thing that I
was able to do was to help develop code that would allow the FCSC to send out
mass emails quickly. When I first started, I thought I should just do what was
expected of me. After awhile, I realized that I could do so much more by
trying to improve efficiency and using the skills I learned at SCU. With that
code, the FCSC cut the time required to send emails in half. It would not have
happened if my managers had not given me the chance to experiment and work on
projects that I wanted to work on. Knowing, during my fellowship, that I was
able to make a difference, I want to continue to be proactive in my
professional life after SCU.

Although I focused on two important lessons I learned during my fellowship, I
believe that I have changed so much from this fellowship. It has helped me
grow as an individual, become more educated about the community, and helped me
prepare for my life after SCU. I am incredibly thankful for this opportunity
to work with the local community and open my eyes to the amazing things that
are done by nonprofits and the public sector.
