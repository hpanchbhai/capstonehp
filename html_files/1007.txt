We asked a few of the Global Fellows to share their summer experiences.

**Brandon Sage**  
 _Major:  Management & Information Systems_  
 _Hometown: San Diego, California_ _  
 _Placement: Bolivia4Ward_  
Graduation Year:  2020_

**What did you do this summer?**  I spent my summer living and working in
Cochabamba, Bolivia as a Global Fellow. My placement, called Bolivia4Ward, is
a free math and science tutoring program under the company AHA Bolivia that is
provided to the kids of the artisans employed by the company and local
orphanages. I helped the company create a system to quantify the progress of
the students and identify the qualitative benefits of the program that would
be useful in their mission to obtain a fair trade certification.

“ _Traveling around the city of Cochabamba to conduct interviews with artisans
opened my eyes to the many different aspects involved with fair trade.”_

**Alyssa Fiddes**

_Major:  Markerting_  
 _Hometown: San Diego, California_ _  
 _Placement:  Destiny Reflections_  
Graduation Year:  2019_

**What did you do this summer?**  Through the Global Fellows Program, I spent
six weeks in Kolkata, India working as a marketing intern for a NGO called
Destiny Reflection. Destiny's goal is to combat sex trafficking as it works to
educate, employ, and empower survivors of trafficking. During this time, I
focused on branding as I redesigned Destiny's website and social media.

_“In addition to being a marketing intern, I taught English and computer
skills classes in the red light district community center.”_

**Gen Kimura**

_Major:  Finance_  
 _Hometown:  Portland, Oregon_ _  
 _Placement:  AHA Bolivia_  
Graduation Year:  2019_

**What did you do this summer?** I had the pleasure of being accepted into
SCU’s Global Fellows program to go to Cochabamba, Bolivia   Along with Ali
Deambrosio and Andrew Bake, we worked for AHA Bolivia, an ethical and
sustainable manufacturer of handmade knitwear products.

“ _Overall, what made this trip so memorable was all of the unique experiences
that I was exposed to from living day-to-day in a completely different country
and meeting people that practice different customs, traditions, and way of
life.”_

**Tanner Condit**  
 _Major:  OMIS_  
 _Hometown:  MIssoula, Montana_ _  
 _Placement:  Franklin Templeton_  
Graduation Year:  2020_

**What did you do this summer?**  I interned for Franklin Templeton in
Hyderabad, India through the Global Fellows Program, where I assisted the US
Transfer Agency Support Services Team. During my internship, I helped improve
department quality through error analysis and curated improvements to the
training program.

_“_ _Several of the SCU Global Fellows groups in India all met up and traveled
to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. It was so much fun and was great to explore
India with the SCU community”_

**Andrew Elliott**

_Major:  Finance_  
 _Hometown:   **Guangzhou, China**_ _  
 _Placement: Bright Generation_  
Graduation Year:  2020_

**What did you do this summer?**  I went to Kumasi, Ghana to work at an NGO
called Bright Generation Community Foundation through the Global Fellows
Program. While there, I was involved in marketing efforts for Bright
Generation as well as for the Bamboo Bike Initiative - an initiative started
by Bright Generation to produce environmentally sustainable bicycles. I also
interviewed women in a local farming community who grow chili peppers in order
to connect them with a zero-interest loan raised by a group of Santa Clara
students.

_“_ _There were some things that were frustrating getting used to in Kumasi,
but visiting them [the people in the community] and seeing the humble
lifestyles they lived put a lot about my experience in Ghana in perspective
and really impacted how I look at life back home.”_
