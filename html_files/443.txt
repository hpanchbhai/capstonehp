Christopher Cabrera is a seasoned executive with more than two decades of
successful senior management experience at both early-stage and public
companies.

Mr. Cabrera is a noted industry expert in issues relating to sales performance
management, sales compensation, and enterprise and on-demand/software-as-a-
service delivery models. He was recently named the 2011 “Alumni Entrepreneur
of the Year” by the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at the USC
Marshall School of Business.

Cabrera is the author of Game The Plan (River Grove Books, 2014) and co-author
of Xactly Sales Compensation for Dummies(Wiley Publishing, 2006), as well as a
contributing writer to such industry publications as Selling Power Magazine,

Prior to founding Xactly Corporation, Mr. Cabrera was senior vice president of
operations for Callidus Software (NASDAQ: CALD), an on-premise incentive
compensation management company. At Callidus, he was responsible for the
execution of worldwide sales and marketing strategies, customer advocacy, and
strategic alliances with companies such as IBM, Accenture and Deloitte. Under
his leadership, the company acquired more than 100 customers, contributing to
the growth of annual revenues from zero to $100M run-rate and a successful IPO
in 2003 raising more than $70M.

Before joining Callidus, Mr. Cabrera spent 7 years in sales and sales
management at Silicon Graphics, a UNIX hardware and software vendor.

Cabrera earned a B.S. degree in business administration with an emphasis in
entrepreneurship from the University of Southern California (USC) and a
