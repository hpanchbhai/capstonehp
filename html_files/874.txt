## Why Do Countries Matter so Much in Corporate Social Performance?

Ye Cai, Carrie H. Pan and Meir Statman

##### Ye Cai, Carrie H. Pan and Meir Statman

Forthcoming, Journal of Corporate Finance.

Abstract:

Why do levels of corporate social performance (CSP) differ so much across
countries? We answer this question in an examination of CSP ratings of more
than 2,600 companies from 36 countries. We find that firm characteristics
explain very little of the variations in CSP ratings. In contrast, variations
in country factors such as stages of economic development, culture, and
institutions account for a significant proportion of variations in CSP ratings
across countries. In particular, we find that CSP ratings are high in
countries with high income-per-capita, strong civil liberties and political
rights, and cultures oriented toward harmony and autonomy. Furthermore, we
find that home country factors explain a smaller portion of the overall
variations in CSP for multinationals and cross-listed firms than for non-
multinationals and pure domestic firms, respectively.
