Meir Statman is the Glenn Klimek Professor of Finance at Santa Clara
University. His research focuses on behavioral finance. He attempts to
understand how investors and managers make financial decisions and how these
decisions are reflected in financial markets. His most recent book is “Finance
for Normal People: How Investors and Markets Behave,” published by Oxford
University Press.

The questions he addresses in his research include: What are investors’ wants
and how can we help investors balance them? What are investors’ cognitive and
emotional shortcuts and how can we help them overcome cognitive and emotional
errors? How are wants, shortcuts and errors reflected in choices of saving,
spending, and portfolio construction? How are they reflected in asset pricing
and market efficiency?

Meir’s research has been published in the Journal of Finance, the Journal of
Financial Economics, the Review of Financial Studies, the Journal of Financial
and Quantitative Analysis, the Financial Analysts Journal, the Journal of
Portfolio Management, and many other journals. The research has been supported
by the National Science Foundation, the Research Foundation of the CFA
Institute, and the Investment Management Consultants Association (IMCA).

Meir is a member of the Advisory Board of the Journal of Portfolio Management,
the Journal of Wealth Management, the Journal of Retirement, the Journal of
Investment Consulting, and the Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance,
an Associate Editor of the Journal of Financial Research, the Journal of
Behavioral Finance, and the Journal of Investment Management and a recipient
of a Batterymarch Fellowship, a William F. Sharpe Best Paper Award, a
Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Outstanding Article Award, a Davis Ethics Award,
a Moskowitz Prize for best paper on socially responsible investing, a Matthew
R. McArthur Industry Pioneer Award, three Baker IMCA Journal Awards, and three
Graham and Dodd Awards. Meir was named as one of the 25 most influential
people by Investment Advisor. He consults with many investment companies and
presents his work to academics and professionals in many forums in the U.S.
and abroad.

Meir received his Ph.D. from Columbia University and his B.A. and M.B.A. from
the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
