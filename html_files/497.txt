Classrooms & Outdoor Space

To reserve a classroom you must contact the Registrar's office
(registrar@scu.edu; 408-554-4331).

University Events Planning (eventplanningoffice@scu.edu; 408.554.6911) has

Courtyard; Franklin Street Patio).

Project Team / Breakout Areas

To reserve the break-out areas, students may go to the following link
<https://www.scu.edu/apps/rooms> and reserve the breakout area. Preference is
given to graduate business students after 4:00 PM. Periodic reviews of all
reservations will be conducted to ensure fair usage.

Students are _**STRONGLY**_ encouraged to reserve the breakout rooms online.
This ensures that reservations are password protected and cannot be accidently
deleted by other members of the community.
