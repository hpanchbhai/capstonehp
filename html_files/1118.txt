Jill Reber

#### CEO, Primitive Logic

Primitive Logic Chair and CEO Jill Reber has played a vital role in the firm’s
executive leadership since 1990, when she came on board as Executive Vice
President, General Counsel, and CFO. Since stepping into the Chair and CEO
position in 2008, Jill has led the company to repeated recognitions as a Best
Place to Work in the Bay Area and on the “Fast 100” list of the region’s
fastest­growing private companies. In 2018, the San Francisco Business Times
recognized Primitive Logic on its list of Top Women­Owned Businesses for the
fifth consecutive year. Jill believes that technology is nothing without
people, and under her leadership, the firm is humanizing technology through a
mindful approach to digital transformation. Jill is a nationally recognized
expert on data privacy — particularly GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection
laws — and has spoken on the topic at conferences sponsored by American
Banker, International In­House Counsel Journal, and other national and
international organizations.

As the premier digital strategy, experience design, and technology consulting
firm, Primitive Logic creates transformative solutions that help companies
thrive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. The firm’s impac across a
variety of industries draws from four main areas of expertise: Digital
Business Strategy, Technology & Business Enablement, Regulatory & Compliance,
and Mergers & Acquisitions Technology Services.

In the technology field, Primitive Logic has helped numerous clients create
value from their data. From data strategy to data architecture to data
governance, the firm helps companies integrate, understand, and maintain the
accuracy of their data to enable them to make informed business decisions.
Primitive Logic has leveraged its deep expertise with data and enterprise
architecture to help companies prepare for and maintain their readiness for
GDPR, CCPA, and other data privacy regulations.

Prior to joining Primitive Logic, Jill owned her own legal practice
specializing in technology law offering general counsel services to startup
tech companies. Her distinguished legal career includes positions as a
litigator at Sedgwick, Detert, Moran & Arnold and at Jeffer, Mangles & Butler.
Jill also co­founded Lieberman and Reber, a securities, real estate, and
business law and litigation firm where she served as the litigation partner
for several years.

Jill holds a Bachelor of Arts with honors in Criminal Justice and Political
Science from the University of Maryland and a law degree from Georgetown
University. She serves as a mentor for social entrepreneurships in third­world
countries through Santa Clara University’s Miller Center for Social
Entrepreneurship. Jill is passionate about giving back to the community and
actively supports programs focused on inner­city youth and environmentally
sensitive issues.
