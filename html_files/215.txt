# Entrepreneurship Minor

  1. [Home](/)
  2. [Leavey School of Business](/business/)
  3. [Undergraduates](/business/undergraduates/)
  4. Entrepreneurship Minor 

Thinking about launching a new venture?

If you're interested in either developing a business or working in a startup
with the chance to explore entrepreneurship as a career option and acquire the
skills that can help them be successful.

Students completing the minor will develop an understanding of the venture
creation process including how to generate and develop a new business concept,
apply quantitative and qualitative methods and analytical tools to identify
and evaluate entrepreneurial opportunities, use data and analysis to create
and evaluate a business plan, and evaluate different funding sources for a new
venture. A critical element of the program is an internship working with an
emerging for-profit startup or socially-beneficial organization to develop an
in-depth case study of the venture and founders, formal business plan or
growth plan.

The entrepreneurship minor is open to all students via an application process
through the Management Department. Accepted business school students may begin
the minor courses after they have completed 60 units. For students outside the
business school, prerequisites for MGMT 164 should ideally be completed in the
sophomore year. International students MUST contact the Global Engagement
Office for information on internship eligibility.

##### Minor Application Process

__

Complete the [Minor in Entrepreneurship application
form](https://docs.google.com/a/scu.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGPQZ74vjzi3qY0czIvW5Rbr17fD0fhB5ZTLlS-
rhGGY4PdA/viewform?c=0&w=1).  The declaration of the minor requires admission
via this application process.

You will be contacted to review your application and discuss course planning.

If your application is approved, you will need to obtain the Program Petition
Form (from the Office of the Registrar or the Undergraduate Business Office).
After you complete the form, leave it with the Management Department
Administrative Assistant (2nd floor of Lucas Hall).

The form will be signed and you will receive an email to pick up the form.  

Return the completed and signed form in its entirety to Drahmann Center
Advising



_**When to apply**_ :  The application process will be rolling; however, the
ideal time would be considered Fall Quarter of your Sophomore year (due to the
60 unit requirement).  Freshmen are welcome to submit an application and meet
with the CIE with the understanding that they may not necessarily be admitted
to the entrepreneurship minor until the Fall of their Sophomore year (or have
met the 60 unit requirement) as space permits.

CIE mailing list to receive the latest updates and information on events,
internships, Silicon Valley event attendance opportunities, counseling on
pitch prep/business plans/startup questions, CIE Office Hours for
Entrepreneurs featuring Silicon Valley angels, VCs and experts and more-to
