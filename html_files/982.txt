  8. From Point A to Point B with ACE Alum, Nick Der

## From Point A to Point B with ACE Alum, Nick Der

ACE Alum, Nick Der, discusses his career path.

Recently, the ACE program was lucky enough to have Nick Der, an alum from the
2014 cohort and founder of Oxford & Brogues, speak to ACE seniors about their
career paths and financial planning. What many people might not know is that
Nick himself has had an interesting career path thus far. Since graduating
from SCU, Nick has had seven different jobs in a variety of industries,
including portfolio management, financial planning, recruiting, real estate,
and even a startup with Jessica Alba. In fact, he has moved around so much
that he stayed at his last job for only three and a half days! Through trial
and error, Nick discovered that he was most passionate about making a
difference for the next generation. He recognized that college students and
millenials often do not receive the financial help that they need, and he
wanted to spearhead the movement in addressing this issue. As a result, Nick
founded Oxford & Brogues, a financial coaching company with the mission of
empowering people in order to transform their relationships to money.

Nick says that his ACE education definitely helped him along his career path.
Through the comprehensive curriculum and connections with various resources,
he was able to have a more elevated conversation about what he wanted in his
career. Nick’s advice for ACE students is to really think about what they want
to achieve in life, or as he calls it, the “Point B”. Once students know what
they want, they can then look backwards and trace the steps to get there from
today’s “Point A”. Ultimately, his objective is to offer comprehensive life
coaching so that students can successfully achieve their goals.

If you are interested in hearing Nick speak, be on the lookout for his
appearance in the “Life After SCU” series in the spring. We thank Nick for his
contributions to the ACE Program and wish him the best as his company
continues to grow!
