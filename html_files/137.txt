_* _Candidates are encouraged to take the Executive Assessment. The Executive
Assessment is specifically designed to evaluate the business school readiness
of seasoned professionals.   The assessment focuses on skills that are
critical both at work and in an EMBA program: higher order reasoning, critical
thinking, analysis, and problem-solving.  Because it was designed specifically
for experienced professionals, it requires modest preparation, takes only 90
minutes to complete, and includes flexible rescheduling options. The test is
administered by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), creators of
the GMAT® exam. Learn more about the Executive Assessment by visiting _[
_gmac.com/ea_](http://www.gmac.com/executive-assessment) _. GMAT and GRE
scores are also accepted.__

##### What is the application deadline for the Executive MBA program?

__

###### After Submitting the Online Application

Once you've submitted a completed application, you will receive confirmation
from our Admissions Team. Upon receiving all application materials, a member
of the Admissions Team will reach out to schedule your final on-campus
interview. Applicants from outside the immediate area will be given the option
of a phone / Skype interview.

###### Admissions Decisions

Applicants are admitted on the basis of academic ability as indicated by
college records and GMAT/GRE, demonstrated career vision for management,
personal and professional recommendations, and motivations to complete a
demanding academic program.

Your Executive MBA application is reviewed only after it is complete and
submitted within the published deadlines:

_**Fall Quarter**_  
Round One / Scholarship Consideration :  **April 1**  
Round Two / Final Application Deadline :  **June 1**

An Admissions interview will be conducted before a final offer of acceptance
is made. Admissions decisions are made within two to three (2-3) weeks after
the final admissions interview.

A $1500 non-refundable tuition deposit is required to secure a position in the
Executive MBA program within four weeks of acceptance to the program.
