#### Chad Brown

 **Class of 2019**  
 **Hometown: Sacramento, California  
** **Finance Major, Political Science Minor**

The Leavey Scholars Program offers an opportunity to connect with other highly
motivated business students.  Business 179S with Sean O'Keefe has been my
favorite class because of the practical and useful tips that I learned in the
class along with the awesome Silicon Valley connections I made as a result of
the class.  During my internship interviews, interviewers always asked about
the Leavey Scholars Program and were always impressed when I described the
program.

#### Madeline Sheridan

 **Class of 2019**  
 **Hometown: Lake Forest, Illinois  **  
 **Accounting  Major**

Being part of the Leavey Scholars Program serves as a really easy talking
point in interviews that allows me to point out some academic strengths in a
natural conversation rather than a typical resume list.

#### Evan Chen

 **Class of 2019**  
 **Hometown:   Portland, Oregon**  
 **Accounting & Information Systems Major  
Sustainability Minor**

The Leavey Scholars Program has given me the opportunity to challenge myself
in classes and learn course material to a greater extent. In addition, I
really enjoy the small class sizes and have gotten to network with the
brightest minds in the Leavey School of Business. My favorite Leavey Scholars
class was OMIS 108S with Tao Li because Professor Li is so nice and makes the
class interesting.

#### Veronica Lu

 **Class of 2019**  
 **Hometown: Maple Glen, Pennsylvania**  
 **Accounting & Information Systems Major**

The Leavey Scholars Program (LSP) has allowed me to work with and learn from
students of a very specific and high performing caliber that has challenged me
and opened my mind to new perspectives.  My favorite Leavey Scholars class is
Operations Management with Tao Li; he is an inspiring and passionate teacher
who picks his students’ brains while teaching valuable work and life lessons.
The LSP put me in an environment in which I was forced to think critically,
act professionally, and compliment the working styles of those around me.

#### Katherine Wickstrom

 **Class of 2019**  
 **Hometown:   Whitinsville, Massachusetts  
Accounting Major**

What I like about the Leavey Scholars Program is the smaller class sizes and
the fact that everyone in the program is willing to work hard and be engaged
during the class. This is especially critical when working in groups.  My
favorite Leavey Scholars class so far has been my MGMT 160S class because I
loved the group that I worked with on the quarter-long project. The overall
class content was also really interesting and all my fellow classmates were
engaged and attentive.

#### Mark So

 **Class of 2019**  
 **Hometown:  Bellevue, Washington**  
 **Finance Major, Music and Communication Minors**

I like that I am constantly challenged by my peers in the Leavey Scholar
classes to perform at a high level.  So far my favorite Leavey Scholars class
has been OMIS 108S with Tao Li; because the subject was refreshing, and
Professor Li was an incredibly engaging, yet hilarious teacher.

#### Kaitlyn Gahrmann

 **Class of 2019**  
 **Hometown:  Hillsborough, New Jersey**  
 **Marketing  Major, Communication and Retail Studies Minors  
**

My favorite part of the Leavey Scholars Program is taking classes with
students of the same drive & excellence. I really enjoyed MKTG 181S; it was
lots of fun, and I enjoyed being in class with like-minded people and having
an opportunity to flourish.

#### Daniel Roberts

 **Class of 2019**  
 **Hometown:  Shingle Springs, California**  
 **Finance and Economics (BS) Majors**

The fast pace of the Leavey Scholars classes allows me to learn more than I
traditionally do in my other business school classes.  My favorite Leavey
Scholars class was FNCE 121S; I enjoyed the fast pace of the class.
