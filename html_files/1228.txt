receives-award-360x239.jpg)

Congratulations to 2013 Outstanding Student Entrepreneur Alexis Babb!  This
honor is awarded annually by the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship to
a graduating student enrolled in the Undergraduate Entrepreneurship Program in
recognition of significant achievements in the program, acknowledgment of
accomplishments in entrepreneurship and the promise of future success.  

## Alexis Babb

Alexis started her first business at age 10 when she crafted some napkin rings
for her mother's dining room table and sold her designs to neighbors.  This
hobby grew into a passion that led to a business she enjoyed and expanded
throughout elementary and middle school--Designs by Alexis.

Alexis started her first business at age 10 when she crafted some napkin rings
for her mother's dining room table and sold her designs to neighbors.  This
hobby grew into a passion that led to a business she enjoyed and expanded
throughout elementary and middle school--Designs by Alexis.  By the time she
graduated high school, she was a vendor in over a dozen craft shows and
holiday boutiques throughout the Bay Area, organized a craft show to raise
more than $1,600 for the American Cancer Society, and had expanded her
business to include a new product line of her own hand-crafted Brazilian agate
jewelry.

Alexis joined the CIE Entrepreneurship Program in her freshman year and served
as an officer of the student club Santa Clara Entrepreneurs Organization.  She
quickly brought her ideas and talents to SCU, serving as chairwoman and
coordinating the Made With Love Craft Show.  She brought more than 35 local
entrepreneurs from the Bay Area to campus selling unique, handmade and
affordable gifts.  Alexis donated all proceeds from the craft show--more than
$1,700--to [Rebekah Children's Services in Gilroy](http://www.rcskids.org/),
California, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the social,
emotional and physical wellbeing of children and families helping children
find homes, get treatment and overcome obstacles for more than 115 years.

With a desire to share her dedication to giving back to the community, Alexis
coordinated an on-campus screening of _[_New
Heroes_](http://www.pbs.org/opb/thenewheroes/)_ , a PBS documentary featuring
social entrepreneurs around the globe.  She also led an executive board of six
students to start and successfully run a new SCU volunteer organization
chapter of Strive For College, where SCU students mentor low-income high
school students throughout their junior and senior years of high school to
help prepare them for graduation and college.  During her two-year term,
Alexis has recruited over 35 mentors and helped 98 high school students in two
high schools.  

Alexis is graduating with a double major in Finance and Economics.  She is
also a Hackworth Business Ethics Fellow, served as the Leavey School of
Business representative at the Hatton W. Summers Undergraduate Ethical
Leadership Conference.  In addition, Alexis was an Undergraduate Business
Programs Peer Advisor, a member of the ACE program, served as Co-President of
Corporate Relations for the Latino Business Student Association, and was a
Learning Leader Program participant.

She has been a shining example of what entrepreneurship at Santa Clara can do
for our communities.  Alexis will receive this award at the Leavey School of
Business Senior Awards Ceremony on June 14 with a presentation by Bill Mains,
Leadership Lecturer in the Undergraduate Business Programs Office.
