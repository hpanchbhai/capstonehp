Majors

The Department teaches undergraduate and masters level business school courses
that provide students with a theoretical and practical understanding of
organizations, of individual and group behavior within organizations, and of
strategic ways of positioning organizations in their industrial, social,
legal, and international environments.

The Department is committed to broadening our understanding of these topics
and of sharing this knowledge with our students, by researching the social and
international environments of business, the strategic management of
organizations, the organizational dynamics of information technologies, and
managerial decision-making particularly within ethical frameworks.

The Department provides a distinctive service to the University through the
leadership roles its members play in the University’s Centers of Distinction
and Business School Administration and Institutes.
