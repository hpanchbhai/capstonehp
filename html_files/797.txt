Pitch Competition.

![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/cie/Alejandro-Rendon-Grand-Prize-
Winner-360x256.jpg)

#### **$10,000 Grand  Prize Winner: Echo Made Easy**

#### Team: Alejandro Rendon (MBA student) and Dilip Ponguru (MBA student)

### The Idea:

Echo Made Easy is a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system, which assists
physicians in the interpretation of medical images. Imaging techniques in
X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal of information
that the radiologist or other medical professional must analyze and evaluate
comprehensively in a short time; a complex process  with large amounts of data
that increase the chances of interpretation errors. The Echo Made Easy
solution prevents many of these errors using CADx to analyze and interpret
medical images more accurately and precisely.

CAREpoint-winners-360x293.jpg)

#### **$1,500 Cancer CAREpoint Prize Winner:** **Boujee on a Budget**

Team: Maria del Carmen Ortega-Flores (Biology Major), Reece Jackson (Computer
Science and Engineering Major/Entrepreneurship and Math Minors), and Polina
Edmunds (Communications Major)

### The Idea:

Boujee on a Budget is a platform that provides healthy recipes, meal plans,
cooking instructions, and budgeting advice for young adults eating on their
own for the first time. Boujee’s mission is to educate college students on how
to live a healthy lifestyle, showing them it’s affordable, enjoyable, not time
consuming, and not as hard as it may seem.



![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/cie/Chad-Calnon-Runner-Up-
Winner-360x426.jpg)

#### **$1,000 Runner-Up Prize Winner: Pakk’d Inc.**

Team: Chad Calnon (Finance Major/Entrepreneurship Minor)

### The Idea:

Pakk’d is a branded smoking glassware company. The founders invented and
designed an invention that automatically “packs” smoking devices, which solves
multiple market pains by eliminating spilling.



#### **Judges**

  * Shawn Lange, CEO and Co-Founder of L2F, Inc., CIE Advisory Board
  * Elizabeth Powers, Counsel at Turner Boyd, LLP, CIE Advisory Board
