## Rick Schaffzin

#### Professor of Practice, Information Systems & Analytics

* * *

Rick Schaffzin is a Professor of Practice of Information Systems & Analytics
at the Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University.  He holds a Ph.D. in
Business Management & Finance from Santa Clara University.

He is the founder of SecureALL, a Silicon Valley privately held company that
has developed a totally innovative security and tracking/monitoring product
utilizing RF communication technology, which addresses both retirement
community and university market verticals.  The company continues to install
its equipment throughout Santa Clara University, as well as on other school
campuses and senior care facilities.

Prior to that, he was the President and CEO of ServGate Technologies, a three-
year old start-up developing very high performance security gateway appliances
based on network processor technology.  Included in the appliance were
gigabit, wire-speed firewall and VPN capability, intrusion detection and virus
scanning.  The product was differentiated from the rest of the market by its
substantially higher performance and lower total cost of ownership.
