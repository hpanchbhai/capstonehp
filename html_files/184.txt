Nilofer Merchant

#### Author, Speaker, Leader

Nilofer Merchant speaks internationally on leadership, appearing with people
like Malcolm Gladwell and Arianna Huffington; has more than 50,000 Twitter
followers; is a Harvard Business Review (HBR) columnist, published the  _Rules
of the #Social Era_ in 2012, and and still gets to walk her son to school
every day.  

That's something she wasn’t often able to do as CEO of Rubicon Consulting,
which advised companies like Adobe, Symantec, Nokia, HP, Genesys and Logitech
on strategy. She decided to close Rubicon in 2010, shortly after her book,
_The New How_ , on collaborative strategy creation, was published. The book
was the culmination of more than a decade on the front lines in the business
world. When she started graduate work in the Leavey School of Business, she
was a mid-level manager. By graduation, she was an executive at a Fortune 500
company, before starting and serving as CEO at Rubicon.

“F. Scott Fitzgerald said ‘Vitality shows in not only the ability to persist
but the ability to start over,’” Merchant said in an interview, adding that
Rubicon was strong, but she was exhausted and ready to do something different.
After an eight-week sojourn in France, she returned to Los Gatos to plan the
next phase of her career.  
  
“I stepped out on this cliff believing there was something else out there for
me, but I wasn’t sure exactly what I wanted to do,” she said. In typical
strategic fashion, she made a list of 10 people she respected, including SCU
professors Barry Posner and André Delbecq, and asked their advice.

“I really wanted to know what other ideas were out there for me. I wasn’t
looking to have any preconceived ideas validated. A third of the group said I
should keep doing what I’m good at. Another third gave me ideas I hadn’t
considered but could imagine, and another third suggested things I’d never
imagined. The process really stretched my envelope of what I would consider.”

The group’s responses also strengthened her view that the modern approach to a
career not only focuses on a particular job, but includes what is necessary to
make a life.

“We’re moving from a world of resumes, to a world of portfolios,” she said.
Her portfolio these days includes continuing to speak (including a popular TED
talk), guest teaching at Santa Clara and Stanford, and serving as a corporate
board member of the People to People Ambassador Program. she was recently
named as one of INC Magazine's Top 50 Leadership Innovators; last year
Thinkers 50 named her as "the #1 person likely to influence the future of
management." She continues to write: drafting a third book, guest columns for
HBR, and on her website,
[www.NiloferMerchant.com](http://www.nilofermerchant.com)[,](http://www.NiloferMerchant.com)
where her blog, "Yes and Know" appears.

“People send me all sorts of problems,” she said. “It’s a fascinating
dialogue. I’m getting a chance to think more deeply about problems with
organizations. We’re still operating under 20th century models in a 21st
century world. As André Delbecq taught me, each of us needs breathing space to
be innovative.”
