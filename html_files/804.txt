Food Insecurity

#### The rise of food banks and the challenge of matching food assistance with
potential need: towards a spatially specific, rapid assessment approach

Chris Bacon (ESS) and Greg Baker (Management and CFIE) recently published a
study that documents the expansion of food banks in industrialized countries
and develops a rapid mapping assessment tool to address the challenge of
matching food assistance with potential need. The study uses this tool to
analyze data provided by the Second Harvest Food Bank to assess the local
challenge of food access in the Silicon Valley. Several undergraduates worked
with Chris and Greg as research assistants, including Lauren Cloward (ESS and
Political Science, 2016). Agriculture and Human Values published this as an
open access article, which is available for download here:

#### Hunger Index Research

![Food-Hunger-Index](/media/leavey-school-of-business/cfie/Food-Hunger-
Index.jpg)

The Center for Food Innovation and Entrepreneurship funds Dr. S. Andrew
Starbird’s Hunger Index research, completed in collaboration with the Second
Harvest Food Bank of Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties.

The Hunger Index was developed to measure hunger for the most food insecure
households within specific counties. The Hunger Index also calculates the
number of meals that are provided by various food assistance organizations and
programs: SFHB, Children and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), Meals on Wheels,
School Meals Program, Senior Nutrition, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamps program), and Woman Infant
and Children (WIC).

The 2013 Hunger Index estimated 814 million meals were required for all low-
income households in 2013. Dr. Starbird found that these families were able to
afford enough food to provide 417 million meals, or a little more than half
their daily needs. Food-assistance programs provided 221 million meals,
leaving 176 million “missing” meals. While the gap is still too big, it is
showing a downward trend compared to the 2012 meal gap of 184 million meals.
The number of low-income households, those earning less than $50,000 annually,
also declined from 260,000 in 2012 to 256,000 in 2013.

#### Market Power in the Fresh Produce Agriculture Sector

This research explores opportunities to reduce food insecurity in California
by examining the potential for community-based hunger relief organizations to
provide a valuable secondary market to California’s agricultural producers.
The paper describes and explains the relationship between market power in the
fresh produce industry and the secondary markets that exist as a result of
supply control. The primary objective is to develop an understanding of the
relationship between the growth of market power in the primary market and the
price of fresh produce product in the domestic secondary markets. It is
concluded that the factors that affect this relationship most significantly
are product price inelasticity and shelf life.

#### Mapping Hunger and Food Assistance in Santa Clara County

![Mapping-Hunger](/media/leavey-school-of-business/cfie/Mapping-Hunger.jpg)

We use Geographic Information Systems to map hunger in Santa Clara County,
California, relying on census data to calculate the percent of households
living at or below 200% of the federal poverty line. We then overlay a plot of
the food assistance distribution points to identify areas where low income
residents do not have easy access to food assistance.

#### Cost of a Healthy Meal

We aim to understand the relationship between food procurement and nutrition
attainment of low-income populations in the Bay Area. Of particular interest
is the gap between food assistance allotments and actual food expenditures.
Over 30 students have helped us conduct over 800 interviews with clients of
Second Harvest Food Bank. Using this data, we analyze how food prices
constrain food purchasing decisions and how those decisions ultimately affect
low-income individuals' nutritional well-being.
