## **Economics**

Economics is the study of how societies organize production,distribution, and
the exchange of goods and services and about choices on how scarce resources
are allocated to satisfy human wants. Who wins? Who loses? Why? Economists use
models that are substantiated by statistical analysis to study important
issues such as economic growth, unemployment, productivity and efficiency,
poverty and inequality, international trade, and the effects of government
policy.

The Economics Department offers [two undergraduate
degrees](https://www.scu.edu/business/economics/academics/), one through the
College of Arts & Sciences, and the other through the Leavey School of
Business. Students have the option to choose a concentration in data analysis
or mathematical economics. The department also provides foundational courses
for the [graduate](https://www.scu.edu/business/graduate-degrees/) programs.

Our faculty produce rigorous state-of-the-art
[research](https://www.scu.edu/business/economics/research/). Students  often
serve as research assistants to [faculty](/business/economics/faculty/ "Home »
Home » Leavey School of Business » Economics » Faculty and Staff"), gaining
hands-on exposure to modern research questions and methods, and occasional
opportunities for co-authorship.

The economics degree provides graduates with a strong foundation to work in a
wide variety of [careers](https://www.scu.edu/business/economics/careers/) and
provides excellent preparation for a broad range of career possibilities from
management and finance to public policy and nonprofit work as well as prepares
students for graduate study in economics, business, and law.
