Students at CAAP Graduation Party

## CAAP News

Eighty students graduated from the CAAP program in 2017 and many of this
year’s graduates were hired before they completed the program.

**2016-17 CAAP program**

![CAAP Students enjoying the summer party](/media/leavey-school-of-
business/accounting/actg-news/CAAP-2017-Summer-Grad-Party-359x241.JPG)

Eighty students graduated from the CAAP program in 2017 (down from 114 per
year in 2016, 2015, and 2014). Over percent of this year’s graduates joined us
from UC-Davis. Many of this year’s graduates were hired before they completed
the program.

In addition to their regular class meetings, this year’s CAAP students
participated in several events and workshops that took place either between
the morning and evening sessions in the summer program or during the lunch
break in the weekend program. This year’s extracurricular workshops and events
(from February 2017 through September 2017) included the following:

  * _Resume Workshop_ , presented by Jon Sakurai-Horita (held during both the summer and weekend programs)
  * _Resume Critiques_ , provided by Jon Sakurai-Horita (during both the summer and weekend programs)
  * _Networking and Career Fair Workshop_ , presented by Jon Sakurai-Horita (held during both the summer and weekend programs)
  * _Interview Skills Workshop_ , presented by Jon Sakurai-Horita (held during both the summer and weekend programs)
  * _Passing the CPA Exam_ , hosted by Becker Professional Education (held during both the summer and weekend programs)
  * _Passing the CPA Exam_ , hosted by Roger CPA Review (held during both the summer and weekend programs)
  * _Firm Info Session and Career Fair Preparation,_ presented by BPM (held during the summer program)

  * _Firm Info Session and Social Media Recruiting_ , presented Novogradac (held during the summer program)
  * _Firm Info Session and Social,_ presented by Standish Management (held during the summer program)
