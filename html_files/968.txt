## Senior Leadership Alumni Spotlight

Justin Wong reflect on his experience with SLA.

![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/undergraduates/sla/IMG_6025-360x300.jpg)

One of this year's Senior Leadership Academy mentors is Justin Wong, a 2011
graduate, who is a Finance Manager at PayPal.  We interviewed Justin to learn
about his perspective as a SCU alumni and former SLA participant.

**_How has your participation in SLA helped you in your professional life?_**

**JW:  **SLA has had such a positive impact on my professional life. The theme
of SLA when I was a participant was “Work-Life Balance and the Transition to
the World of Work”. It was an awesome opportunity where I was fortunate enough
to have dinners with Silicon Valley executives and I met young alumni. I
learned about their experiences, transitions, and even the not so positive
moments in their careers. Being involved in SLA has not only prepared me for
the professional world, but also encouraged me to be a mentor and give back to
a program that had a positive impact on my career.

**_What advice can you offer to ease the transition from college to becoming a
working professional?_**

**JW:  **Some advice that I've learned throughout my career include the
following:

  * Network, network, network! Silicon Valley is smaller than you think and everyone is connected.
  * It's okay to ask questions.
  * Find a mentor outside of your team.
  * Connect and befriend other new grads within the company.

**_What is your favorite memory from SCU or SLA?_**

**JW:  **It's hard to pick just one! Having the opportunity to play on the
men's tennis team, be an assistant coach on the women's tennis team, and being
able to study abroad through SCU’s London program were some of my favorite
memories.
