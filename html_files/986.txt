March Madness is here... and in the ACE Program it means we’ve reached the end
of a very busy quarter for everyone. We’ve enjoyed working with the sophomores
on their professional development skills and seeing the juniors through a
stressful (their word), but immensely helpful,  etiquette dinner. Our
signature Senior Dinner was a lovely event and we were thrilled to be
celebrating the great work of our seniors before they graduate.

As you near finals, good luck preparing and enjoy a well-deserved spring
break!

**Calling all Spoons, Forks and Knives: Etiquette Tips for Dining**

dinner-2019-200x200.JPG)

A few weeks ago, the ACE 2020 Cohort participated in an Etiquette Dinner led
by Gina Snyder. There, students were able to learn how to conduct themselves
in a professional, fine-dining type of environment. Here are some tips and
tricks that Gina shared with the 2020 Cohort that they found useful:

  1. When moving to the dinner table after appetizers have been served, don’t bring anything to the table. Any cups, plates, and napkins should be left aside before sitting down.
  2. Put your phone away! Remember that you are there for business, so you want to make sure your phone is not distracting you or others.
  3. When deciding what to order, or what is okay to order, follow suit with what your host decides.
  4. In regards to utensils, remember that you are using the utensils on the outside first, then working your way in. So, on your left (from left to right) should be your salad fork, followed by your dinner fork. On your right (from left to right) is your dinner knife, salad knife, dinner spoon, and soup spoon.
  5. Typically your host will pay the bill, so be mindful of that when the dinner is over.
  6. Don’t forget to send your host a thank you note for the dinner within 24 hours!  

Thank you again to Gina Snyder for teaching us business dining etiquette!
