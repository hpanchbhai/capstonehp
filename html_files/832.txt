# Project Team Room Policies

  7. Project Team Room Policies 

To reserve this room online, you may go to
[www.scu.edu/rooms](http://www.scu.edu/rooms)

With only 16 individual small group project rooms to be shared among all
Business School students, group study space is a shared resource. We ask that
you be considerate of others and work to ensure equitable access to these
spaces for all members of the Business School community. Success in achieving
this goal will help minimize the bureaucracy related to room use.

## Some overall guidelines:

  * The rooms are intended for group collaboration, not individual study. While individuals may use a room on a drop-in basis if it is not scheduled, please be gracious about surrendering the space if requested by a group.

  * The rooms are intended primarily to further academic activities. Use good judgment about appropriate times for non-academic uses to ensure academic needs are met.

  * Please return the rooms to their proper configuration, with two chairs on each side of the table, erase the white board, and remove all debris.

  *  If any of the equipment in the room doesn’t work properly would you kindly report that to theDukes Business Center either in person or send them an email at Dukes-BusCtr@scu.edu.



## Any reservation for a group study room MUST:

  * be for two hours or less.

  * contain the name of a Santa Clara University student, faculty, or staff member.

  * contain a valid scu.edu email address associated with the individual who made the reservation.

  * start at least one hour after any previous reservation for that room by the same person ended.

  * not overlap with another reservation by the same person for a different room.

_Reservations that violate one or more of these guidelines will be deleted_



### Some useful hints:

  * Room reservations can be made up to a week in advance.

  * Reservations made online must be confirmed within 10 minutes of the scheduled start time by

touching the flashing "Start" button that will be displayed on the Room Wizard
located near the

door, or the reservation will be lost.

  * To protect your reservation with a password, so it cannot accidentally be deleted by someone

else, use the advanced reservation feature by clicking on the link to the
right of the "Purpose" box on the reservation screen. This same feature allows
you to email other members of your group a copy of the reservation.

  * Free rooms are indicated by green lights on the side of the Room Wizard and may be reserved on the spot by touching the "Use Now" button on the screen.

  * Preference is given to Business Graduate Students after 4:00 p.m. Undergraduates should try to limit their use of the break out rooms to hours prior to 4:00 p.m.

As with many things about our new building, policy about use of the
collaborative rooms is subject to change based on experience and need.
