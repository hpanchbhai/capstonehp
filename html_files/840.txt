## The Certificate of Advanced Accounting Proficiency Updates

The CAAP program recently saw 110 students complete the program, launched a
specialized marketing campaign, and introduced new career resources to its
students for success after the completion of the program.

Our [Certificate of Advanced Accounting Proficiency (CAAP)
program](/business/caap/ "Home » Home » Leavey School of Business »
Certificate of Advanced Accounting Proficiency") continues to be one of the
most time-effective and affordable accounting programs in the country,
providing all the courses necessary to sit for the California CPA exam in 14
weeks (during the summer with classes that meet daily) or in 9 months (during
the academic year program that meets on the weekends).

This year we had 110 students graduate from the summer and weekend programs.
Most of our students were able to find accounting positions through a Summer
CAAP Career Fair and Fall Meet the Firms Night, as well as a resume book that
we send to interested firms each February.

To attract more students, this year we began holding monthly information
sessions about the CAAP program. In these sessions, CAAP Program Director Toni
Santillan presents a general overview of the program, while CAAP Faculty
Director Suzanne Luttman discusses the academic aspects of the program and how
that can matriculate to passage of the CPA exam and job opportunities.
Graduates from the CAAP program also appear in each monthly session to share
their experience about what taking accounting in such a condensed format is
like. They demonstrate that it takes a lot of commitment and sacrifice to
finish the program that quickly, but they all conclude that it was well worth
the effort.

Another change this year was the introduction of a more focused advertising
campaign for the program. The Leavey School of Business' head of marketing,
Theresa Strickland, provided her expertise to better tailor the advertising
needs of our programs to our target markets, which has resulted in a much
better marketing mix to attract students to our program. You’ll still hear the
ads on Pandora, but may also notice them on alternative sources and formats.

For CAAP graduates, we greatly appreciate your willingness to share your
expertise about how to make it successfully through the program to new
potential entrants. If you’d be willing to volunteer to talk to them at either
a monthly information night or during the orientation, please let Toni know
(tsantillan@scu.edu). The students really appreciate your honest discussion of
the CAAP experience, and your success stories since you’ve graduated!

If you are a potential employer of the CAAP students, contact Toni regarding
your attendance at our career events.
