About

![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/undergraduates/Sports-Business-Club-
Logo-360x360.png)

Santa Clara University's Sports Business Club provides students with resources
and opportunities to enhance and build a career in the sports industry. This
club explores the intersection of business fundamentals with the entertainment
and awe found in athletics. Our coordinated efforts with distinguished guest
speakers, alumni, and professionals help students gain a better understanding
of the duties and responsibilities of a career in the sports marketing, sports
management, sports finance, ticket sales, operations, and sports journalism
fields.

**Letter from the President:**

As someone who has always been intrigued by the nature of sports, I created
this organization to meet people who share this same interest. From members to
guest speakers, it is astounding to hear about the various views each person
has about sports, and being able to cultivate different opinions and ideas as
President of this organization is something that I am very proud of. It is our
first full year of existence, yet we've already reached goals that we had set
to accomplish further down the line. We are excited to continuously grow our
organization here on campus and throughout the Bay Area, all as part of Santa
Clara's distinguished Leavey School of Business. Go Broncos!



Ashish Prasad

President, Santa Clara University Sports Business Club
