__[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](/media/leavey-school-of-

* * *

Dr. Michael Schermann is the MSIS Faculty Director, and assistant professor in
the Department of Information Systems & Analytics at the Leavey School of
Business at Santa Clara University. He was a senior research fellow and
principal investigator at Technische Universität München, Germany and visiting
researcher at the University of Melbourne, Australia. He holds master's degree
in Information Systems from Technische Unversität Dresden, Germany and a Ph.D.
in Information Systems from Technische Universität München, Germany.

Michael’s expertise is in the areas of risk management, information technology
outsourcing, and human-computer interaction. He has published his
interdisciplinary research in journals such as ACM Transactions of Computer-
Human Interaction, Journal of Information Technology, Journal of Management
Accounting Research, Business Information Systems & Engineering, and in
conferences such as the International Conference on Information Systems
(ICIS).

He teaches and has taught courses in enterprise resource planning, information
management, and service engineering in graduate and undergraduate programs.
Michael developed the award-winning white-collar hacking contest, a novel
approach to teach forensic accounting and business ethics in the digital
world. It is a round-based contest, where participants in turn act as those
who commit fraud and as forensic accountants. State-of-the-art enterprise
information systems serve as the playing field for the game.
