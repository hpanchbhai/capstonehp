different major with an MIS or Business Analytics minor.

Pie_1-360x283.png)

As an ISA student, you will explore the use of computer information systems
and analytical decision-making methods in organizations. You will take courses
that combine theoretical concepts with applications to real-life problems, and
participate in labs and projects that will allow you and your peers to work as
a group to develop software programs and business applications.

Essential to the conduct of business, these skills will equip you to design,
implement, and evaluate day-to-day management systems central to an
organization's success.
