He has more than 35 professional publications in leading academic journals

collaborative-commerce/international-commerce-review-ecr-journal/)_. He serves
in senior leadership positions for several of these journals (see bottom of
this page). In 2014 his book   _[Designing and Controlling the Outsourced
Supply Chain](http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/0200000030)_ was published by [NOW
Publishers](http://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/TOM-030). Download a
free PDF of this book and Dr. Tsay's other publications

His publications have been cited more than 5500 times (according to [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zHjE-J0AAAAJ&hl=en)). His
2008 paper in _Journal of Supply Chain Management_ (with Roth, Pullman, and
Gray) received a 2012 _[Emerald Management Reviews Citation of
Excellence](http://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/authors/literati/citations/awards.htm?id=2012)_
, awarded to only 50 articles worldwide across all business specialties.

He has consulted for large firms as well as startups in Silicon Valley and
China. He has been interviewed extensively in the [global
media](https://www.scu.edu/business/isa/faculty/tsay/media/), by outlets such
as _The New York Times_ , ABC News, Voice of America, CCTV, and _China Daily._
He has lectured to academic and industry audiences throughout North America,
Europe, and Asia.

He serves frequently as a visiting professor at [Peking
University](http://www.pku.edu.cn/), teaching in the [Beijing International
MBA](http://en.bimba.pku.edu.cn/) program, which has honored him with its
_Teaching Excellence Award_.

In 2007 the [Production & Operations Management Society](http://www.poms.org/)
(POMS) recognized Dr. Tsay with the _[Wickham Skinner Award for Teaching
Innovation](http://www.poms.org/skinner_awards/)_. POMS is the premier
international professional society for the study and practice of Operations
Management, with more than 2,000 members in 60 countries. One such award is
given each year.

He is an eight-time recipient of the Leavey School of Business _Dean's Award
for Extraordinary Performance in Research, Teaching, and Service_. He has won
