Betsy Berkhemer-Credaire

#### CEO, 2020 Women on Boards  
CEO, Berkhemer Clayton Retained Executive Search

In January 2018, Betsy was named national CEO of the 501c3 nonprofit public
awareness campaign called “2020 Women on Boards” dedicated to achieving at
least 20% of all public company board seats held by women by the year 2020.
Its website 2020WOB.com tracks the Russell 3000 Index companies in the U.S.
citing how many women are on each board, if any. As of 2018, the national
statistic is 17.7% of all board seats in the Russell 3000 are held by women;
and one-fourth of all public companies don’t have any women directors.

Author of the book "The Board Game – How Smart Women Become Corporate
Directors," with 10,000 copies in distribution nationally, Betsy explains how
58 women directors found their first board seats. For 17 years, Betsy chaired
the Los Angeles/Orange County chapter of Women Corporate Directors (WCD), a
global nonprofit network of women serving on public and private boards. She is
a frequent keynote speaker throughout the U.S.

Based in downtown Los Angeles, Betsy co-founded Berkhemer Clayton Inc. 25
years ago, specializing in senior management Communications, Marketing,
Finance and Board searches for corporations, universities and large
nonprofits. Client companies include Bank of America, GAP, Mattel, Toyota USA,
Ross Stores, Southern California Gas Company, Sempra, Kaiser Permanente,
Tournament of Roses, City of Hope, UCLA, USC, Chapman University, American
Lung Association, Big Brothers Big Sisters Los Angeles, and more.

Since 2000, she has served on the statewide board of the National Association
of Women Business Owners-California (NAWBO-CA), representing the issues and
interests of 1.5 million women business owners in CA. She was on board of
Southern California Leadership Network (SCLN) for 25 years, and the advisory
boards of Edison (SCE) and UCLA Medical Center. Before going into retained
executive search, Betsy built a major public relations agency in downtown Los
Angeles which was acquired by global firm Golin/Harris based in Chicago. She's
a  
graduate of UCLA. She lives in Little Tokyo, downtown Los Angeles.
