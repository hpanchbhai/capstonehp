## Haibing Lu

#### Department Chair, Associate Professor, Information Systems & Analytics

__[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](/media/leavey-school-of-
business/isa/Haibing_Lu_Sept_2018.pdf)

* * *

Dr. Lu joined the Department of Information Systems & Analytics in the Leavey
School of Business at Santa Clara University in Fall 2011. He is the co-chair
of the department and currently teaches undergraduate courses in the ISA
program and graduate courses in the MSIS program. He is a frequent recipient
of the school’s Extraordinary Research Award and Extraordinary Teaching Award.

Dr. Lu’s research is at the confluence of privacy, security, data mining, and
optimization. He is particularly interested in developing effective and
efficient data analysis techniques to resolve privacy issues in data-oriented
applications, such as statistical database and role-based access control for
large-scale authorization. He also has broad interests in applied cryptography
and fundamental methods of data mining, such as secure multi-party
computation, revocable fine-grained encryption, overlapping clustering, and
pattern discovery from high-dimensional binary datasets. He has published in
refereed journals and conference proceedings, such as IEEE Transaction on
Dependable and Security Computing (TDSC), INFORMS Journal on Computing (JOC),
Journal of Computer Security (JCS), IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy
(S&P), ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining (KDD), SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM), and IEEE
International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM).

Dr. Haibing Lu received his Ph.D. in Management (Information Technology) in
2011 from Rutgers University, where he was a teaching assistant as he
completed his doctoral studies. He earned his B.S. and M.S. degrees both in
mathematics from Xi’an Jiaotong University, China, in 1998 and 2002
respectively.
