  7. Madi Clelland: The Power of Saying Yes! 

## Madi Clelland: The Power of Saying Yes!

Madi discusses her year working at Cristo Rey, and why she is thankful for the
experience.

Looking back on my year at Cristo Rey, I have become engaged in a community in
a way that I didn’t know was possible going in to this experience.  I have,
not only, gotten to know my co-workers on a personal level, but have met many
students who make me so excited to be a part of the Cristo Rey community.
While learning valuable business skills through my Salesforce and engagement
projects, I have also strengthened my communication skills and formed strong
bonds in all aspects during this opportunity.

Throughout the entire year, one of my main goals had been to interact more
with the students on a daily basis.  This past quarter, I have had the
opportunity to drive students back to school after their work day. Every
Thursday afternoon, I get in a giant white van, drive into downtown San Jose
and pick up 8 sophomore students from a bus stop.  The first few times, I was
so nervous that I didn’t even turn the radio on and we all just sat in
silence. As I started to learn the students’ faces and remember their names,
it became a much more boisterous drive. While, at first, I didn’t quite know
how I could turn this specific instance into a lesson or a new skill learned,
that quickly changed the more I had time to reflect on it.  I have realized
that deciding to, simply, say yes when asked to do tasks, like drive the
students, led me to incredible experiences. So many times, I have thought
about what type of risk a decision has associated with it especially in
regards to career. It took a lot of courage to start saying yes to everything
at Cristo Rey; but once I did, I realized that there were more opportunities
and experiences than I could have imagined.

This year at Cristo Rey has been an experience that I am so thankful for and
will never forget.  I have learned a lot about myself and the nonprofit world.
Although I don’t plan on working in the nonprofit sector post graduation, I
know that it is something that I want to continue to be a part of in any way
that I can.
