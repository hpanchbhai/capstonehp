Anthony Prieto and Dan Aguiar, Executive Director of Entrepreneurship Programs

Entrepreneur Anthony Preito!  This honor is awarded annually by the Center for
Innovation and Entrepreneurship to a graduating student enrolled in the
Undergraduate Entrepreneurship Program in recognition of significant
achievements in the program, acknowledgment of accomplishments in
entrepreneurship and the promise of future success.  

Anthony graduates with an Operations Management and Information Systems Major,
a Retail Studies Minor and is one of the first students to receive a Minor in
Entrepreneurship.

Before Anthony joined Santa Clara University from his hometown of Encinitas,
he already had a successful startup under his belt.  His interest in
technology was well known with his family, so when a cousin asked Anthony to
develop a website for his chiropractic practice, Anthony jumped at the
challenge.  He enjoyed it so much that when asked "why don't you start your
own business doing this?" he agreed.  That was the beginning of [The Simple
Web Solution](http://www.thesimplewebsolution.com/).  His company has built
custom websites for clients around the country in a variety of business
sectors and industries.

![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/cie/Bronco-Student-Services-
Logo-200x200.jpg)Here at Santa Clara, it wasn't long into his freshman year
before he and a friend came up with the idea of a campus food delivery
srevice.  Anthony and Arthur Gallagher wasted no time doing their research,
testing, and working through the various channels at the University and Bon
Appetit to make this a reality.  It clicked in 2010 when they purchased
[Bronco Student Services](http://www.broncoss.com/): a student-developed
startup that provides SCU students with door-to-door laundry service and
summer/abroad storage.  They added the delivery service to Bronco Student
Services' successful platform and it's been off and running-literally-ever
since.

Anthony got involved with the Center for Innovation & Entrepreneurship in his
freshman year, later serving as the Co-President of the SCEO (Santa Clara
Entrepreneurs Organization) undergraduate student club, which, under his
leadership, has grown to one of the largest clubs on campus.  He also served
as an officer of the Retail Studies Student Association and was active in the
OMIS student network and the MarComm network.  He has been an active
participant in various competitions on campus, has serves as a competition
judge, was a panelist for the CIE's Global Entrepreneurship Week student
entrepreneur panel, worked together with other students and the CIE to bring
Startup Expo to fruition (Startup Expo is a unique internship fair that brings
Silicon Valley startups to Santa Clara to share internship opportunities with
our students), presented to the CIE Advisory Board, was a repeat featured
speaker with the CIE at Parents' Weekend, was a featured speaker with the
Freshman Entrepreneurship Cohort of the Dean's Leadership Program, and has
even taught a workshop on Google Apps through the University's Technology
Training Courses.

His enthusiasm to bring people and events together to share knowledge and
expertise is infectious-you cant talk to Anthony without immediately
recognizing his passion and drive for the entrepreneurial spirit. Anthony was
presented with this award at the Leavey School of Business Senior Awards
Ceremony on June 15 with a presentation by Dr. Kumar Sarangee, Assistant
Professor of Marketing.
