Students Stephanie Sam and Philip Barber internship feature

## Junior Internships

The summer is an exciting time for our juniors as they begin their internships
at Silicon Valley companies and beyond.

The summer is an exciting time for our juniors as they begin their internships
at Silicon Valley companies and beyond. All of the ACE juniors will complete a
summer experience, and two of our juniors, Stephanie Sam and Phillip Barber,
share more about what they will be doing at their internships.

![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/undergraduates/ace/Stephanie-
Sam-200x200.jpg)

Stephanie Sam, a MIS major and Communication minor, has an internship with
Deloitte as a Risk and Financial Advisory Intern. In the summer after her
sophomore year Stephanie attended Deloitte’s Envision Leadership Conference.
This experience helped her decide to accept her internship offer for the
summer.

Although Stephanie does not know what team she has been assigned to yet, her
anticipated role as an intern will be to work with clients “to identify
business and strategic risks to help businesses become more resilient”. She is
also especially looking forward to working alongside the knowledgeable and
passionate professionals at Deloitte, and being able to learn from them.

Stephanie is excited to apply the knowledge she has gained in the classroom to
her upcoming internship, and is grateful to ACE for helping her “make the
connection between... academics and professional development.”

Barber-200x198.jpg)

Our other featured junior is Phillip Barber, who is a Finance major and
Information Systems/Spanish double minor. Phillip will be interning at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch this summer in the company’s Mergers and Acquisitions
group of the Investment Banking division.

As a Summer Analyst, Phillip will be working alongside full-time analysts on
M&A deals in accomplishing technical background work, which entails
project/company valuation, development and maintenance of financial models,
and material preparation for client presentations. He found his internship by
utilizing the Santa Clara alumni network to help him get interviews with a
number of bulge bracket banks.

Phillip is looking forward to pushing himself to meet and exceed the high
expectations set by a fast-paced work environment, while simultaneously
developing a valuable technical finance background. He is eager to begin his
career “working and learning under an elite team of finance experts” at BAML,
especially because the company has a formidable track record of success.

Congratulations and best of luck to Stephanie, Phillip, and all of our
juniors!
