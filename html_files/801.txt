CFIE Feeding the World Pathway

The Feeding the World (FTW) pathway focuses on the complex interrelationships
among food production, food consumption, hunger, poverty, and the environment.
Students in the pathway will explore how the production, consumption, and
distribution of food resources are impacted by a variety of factors, including
the availability of resources, income levels, and environmental degradation.
Classes will also address the production of food in fragile environments and
the sustainability of subsistence food systems, including the role of
agricultural development in reducing hunger and poverty throughout the world.
Undergraduate students can declare the Pathway through ECampus and will then
have access to the opportunities available through the Center for Food
Innovation and Entrepreneurship.

The Center for Food Innovation and Entrepreneurship runs BUSN 150 and 151,
which are considered CFIE classes within the FTW Pathway. Class descriptions
for the classes can be found below:

* * *

##### BUSN 150: Feeding the World

__

In this course, students examine the global system for the production and
distribution of food, assess the ability of the system to satisfy the human
demand for food, and evaluate the impact of the system on the natural
environment. Students will employ tools from statistics, operations, and
economics to describe, analyze, and forecast imbalances between food supply
and food demand. Through a term project, students use their new skills to
examine the food system in a developing nation experiencing chronic hunger. (5
units)

##### BUSN 151: Food, Hunger, Poverty, Environment Immersion

__

This course is designed to help students meet their social justice-oriented
experiential learning requirements while learning about issues related to food
production and consumption, hunger, poverty, and the environment. The course
blends short lectures, guided discussions and reflections, and a 10- to 12-day
immersion in a selected country interacting with local people of diverse
backgrounds for experiential active learning. The goal is to increase
students' understanding of the role of business in the developing world and to
explore the role of business in alleviating poverty through economic
development and the pursuit of social justice. (2 units)

##### Enrichment Programs

programs](/business/cfie/education-at-cfie/internship-opportunities/ "Home »
Home » Leavey School of Business » Center for Food Innovation and
Entrepreneurship » Education at CFIE » Enrichment Programs")**  offered by the
Center for Food Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CFIE).

Through the ****Internship Program**** , students have the opportunity to
apply their classroom education in a professional work environment.

The CFIE's ****Mentor Program**** connects students with professionals working
in the students’ areas of interest.

The ****Field Trips and  Immersive Study Trips**** offered through the Center
expose students to the rich diversity of the food industry through domestic
and international field experiences.

In addition to enrichment programs, students are encouraged to participate in
educational and social events offered throughout the year.

##### Research Fellowships

__

The CFIE encourages FHPE pathway students to apply for a research fellowship.
The purpose of the fellowship is to promote a greater understanding of the
complex connections and relationships among food, hunger, poverty, and the
environment. The fellowships are aligned with the University’s commitment to
“foster a culture supportive of undergraduate research.” Fellows receive a
stipend and are expected to engage in their research project for a full year.
The application process for fellows occurs during the spring quarter.
