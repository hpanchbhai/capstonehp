######        Dan Aguiar, Executive Director of Entrepreneurship Programs, and
Sol Tran

Congratulations to 2010 Outstanding Student Entrepreneur Sol Tran!  This honor
is awarded by the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship to a graduating
student enrolled in the Undergraduate Entrepreneurship Program in recognition
of significant achievements in the program, acknowledgment of accomplishments
in entrepreneurship and the promise of future success.

An true role model for all students enrolled in the CIE program, Sol has been
an exemplary student of entrepreneurship with the experience of his own
startups, winning various competitions, attending national conferences, and
all of his contributions to the undergraduate Santa Clara Entrepreneurs
Organization (SCEO).

#### Sol's Startups

An ardent entrepreneur himself, Sol had started up several companies
throughout his time at Santa Clara. His freshman year, he and his business
partner Raju Sagiraju be![](/media/leavey-school-of-
business/cie/CEO-10c_1-360x241.jpg)gan to build YourQuad.com, a high school
blog site that would serve as an online hub for schools regarding campus
activities, sports, and more. Learning from his initial experience, he
progressed through his sophomore year and decided to start
[CampusKiwi](http://campuskiwi.com/) as Chief Financial Officer with Chief
Executive Officer Conrad Egusa. As CFO, Sol gained tremendous hands-on
[experience](http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2009/05/14/teens-impress-
investors-at-tech-conference/) with sales, website work, and pitching to many
Venture Capitalists and other investors _._ Currently, a new startup of Sol's
may be underway!



#### Santa Clara Entrepreneurs Organization

Involved since his freshman year, Sol soon became Co-President of the Santa
Clara Entrepreneurs Organization and worked diligently to strengthen various
aspects the club. When asked about his commitment to the organization, Sol
replied, "SCEO was my biggest passion at Santa Clara University." Indeed, the
club grew as it implemented many new events, competitions, speakers, a fully-
functional website, and much more.

     ![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/cie/BeAVC_2-360x241.jpg)

#### Competitions

Through his involvement with SCEO, Sol has taken part in several competitions
on and off campus related to entrepreneurship. Congratulations once again on
winning the 2009 Furlong Business Plan Competition and 2011 Internal Be A
Venture Capitalist (BeAVC) Competition, and also on being a finalist in the
Venture Capitalist Investment Competition at Stanford and twice in the
Regional BeAVC Competition!



     ![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/cie/BeAVC-11_2-360x241.jpg)

#### Conferences

Taking the initiative to further develop his skills and network as an
entrepreneur, Sol has attended various national conferences that focus on
startups and new innovation. He has been to the TiEcon conference, Tech Crunch
conference in New York, and the Collegiate Entrepreneurs' Organization
conference in Chicago.![](/media/leavey-school-of-
business/cie/CEO-10_1-360x241.jpg)

#### Other Startups

Sol has served significantly at a few other startups in the Silicon Valley as
an intern, and, in doing so, was able to work at different stages of company
growth from beginning to end. At Kase Networks, a systems management company,
Sol was the head of social marketing and a lead generation analyst. He even
had the unique opportunity to sit right next to the CEO and all of the VPs as
the company's revenue tripled and was acquired by Dell. Sol later on worked
for a rising Facebook advertising company, GraphScience, as the seventh
employee. As he saw his direct individual impact on the company's success, his
love for being an entrepreneur was even further cemented.

#### CIE Involvement

Sol has been an ambassador of the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship
and an exceptional role model for students in the program. Not only has he
received his Certificate in Entrepreneurship, but he has also taken full
advantage of all of the opportunities offered by the CIE. He has met with
mentors, attended various Silicon Valley events in the area, and has always
been an advocate for events sponsored by the CIE.

  * Sol has written 9 TechBeat articles for SCU's school newspaper, _[The Santa Clara](http://www.thesantaclara.com/)_ , on Tech Crunch, Top 10 Tech Trends, The Future of Smartphones, Lacrosse, and more!
  * Sol's personal goals include starting his own company to sell for at least $50 million, and someday become a Venture Capitalist!

     ![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/cie/CEO-10f_1-360x241.jpg)

Sol will receive this Outstanding Student Entrepreneur Award at the Leavey
School of Business Senior Awards Ceremony on June 10 presented by H. Buford
