## [2019 CAAP Program applications are now
open!](https://slate.scu.edu/apply/?sr=c7706d42-f5e1-40a7-86cf-cc9c002a9e89)

##### Prerequisites

__

Applicants must have a bachelor’s degree in a field other than accounting from
a regionally accredited U.S. college or university or a foreign equivalent.
Applicants must submit an official transcript showing the degree has been
conferred.

Students who have earned a master’s degree may choose to submit their official
transcripts from their completed master’s program in lieu of undergraduate
transcripts. All international transcripts must be evaluated. Evaluations must
show U.S. bachelor degree equivalency and final cumulative grade point
average.

Students whose undergraduate or graduate GPA is lower than 2.5 must submit
both a statement of purpose and a letter of recommendation in addition to
transcripts. Low GPA does not disqualify a student from acceptance.

##### When to Apply

__

Students are admitted on a rolling basis. Though there is no deadline for
applications, it is recommended that potential students apply early in the
application cycle.

The 2019 application for both the Weekend and Summer Program will open in
January.

Not sure which format is right for you? [Register](/business/caap/caap-info/
"Home » Home » Leavey School of Business » Certificate of Advanced Accounting
Proficiency » RSVP Form CAAP Info Sessions") for a free CAAP Information
Session (held monthly January through August) or contact us directly at
[caap@scu.edu](mailto:caap@scu.edu) or 408-554-4522.

##### Choosing a Cohort

__

##### Summer Program

During the Summer Program students will take 45 quarter units of accounting
courses within 14 weeks and meet every weekday. Students applying for the
Summer Program can indicate their preference for placement in either the AM or
PM cohort. The AM cohort meets from 9:00AM - 1:00PM, while the PM cohort meets
from 2:30PM - 6:30PM. Each course lasts eight or nine consecutive days, Monday
- Friday.

Since the CAAP Summer Program is the fastest ** ** way to approach the CPA
exam, a significant number of hours of homework are expected each night. This
program is both time and effort consuming, so it is recommeneded that
participants do not work while completing the program.

##### Weekend Program

Students in the Weekend Program take the courses for about ten months.
Students applying for the Weekend Program can indicate a preference for taking
courses on either Saturday OR Sunday for 8 HOURS each day (from 9AM - 6PM with
a one-hour break). Each course lasts about five weeks. After one course ends,
the next course begins. The highlight of this program is that students can
complete the accounting units for the CPA exam while working weekdays within
one year!

The Weekend Program is designed for students who work full-time, and still
have the ambition to accomplish something bigger. However, due to the
intensity of the program, do expect about 20 or more hours of homework each
week.
