Eva Sage-Gavin

#### Senior Managing Director, Talent & Organization, Accenture

Eva Sage-Gavin is senior managing director of Accenture’s Global Talent and
Organization consulting practice. She leads the team that helps Accenture’s
clients harness digital technologies and evolve their workforces to innovate,
unlock new sources of value and “lead in the new.” She also plays a pivotal
role in shaping the practice’s market strategy, including offerings and
investments.

Ms. Sage-Gavin is a distinguished human resources thought leader with more
than three decades of broad experience in Fortune 500 global consumer,
technology and retail corporations. For 11 years, she was the chief people
officer and head of corporate affairs at Gap Inc., where she led the company's
human resources, communications, government affairs, social responsibility and
foundation teams and was responsible for 136,000 employees who served
customers in 90 countries. As a legacy of her leadership, Gap received the
Catalyst Award, which recognized the company's commitment to a “culture of
equality, where everyone has the opportunity to stand as equals and thrive.”

Serving in executive HR and C-suite leadership roles at PepsiCo, Disney
Consumer Products, Sun Microsystems and Xerox, Ms. Sage-Gavin has shaped the
business and human capital strategies for top global brands to compete in an
increasingly connected world, fueled by rapid advances in technology and
massive workforce change.

Ms. Sage-Gavin was recently a senior advisor at Boston Consulting Group (BCG)
and contributed to BCG's CEO Advisory practice, directly coaching CEOs, as
well as consulting on the future of work and the latest trends in human
capital strategy. She also served as a senior advisor to G100 companies,
contributing to CEO, board and chief human resource officer learning
communities and delivering the latest insights and actionable ideas on
leadership, talent strategies and innovation.

Throughout her global leadership career, she has been a champion of equality,
diversity and inclusion and has brought this expertise to boardrooms. In fact,
she is one of the first women to serve on public technology company boards.
She has also served as a co-chair for the Woman Corporate Directors Northern
California chapter.

Ms. Sage-Gavin believes in the power of private and public partnerships and
actively volunteers for causes about which she is passionate. She has served
as vice chair of Aspen Institute's Skills for America's Future advisory board,
which was focused on building skilled workforces and closing the skills-
employment gap nationally. Committed to education, mentoring and lifelong
learning, she serves at Cornell University as executive in residence in the
School of Industrial and Labor Relations, where she was also the former chair
of the Center for Advanced Human Resource Studies. In addition, she has been
executive in residence of Santa Clara University’s Initiative on Women’s
Economic Empowerment and a guest lecturer at Stanford University's Graduate
School of Business for over 15 years.

Ms. Sage-Gavin holds a degree in industrial and labor relations from Cornell
University. She enjoys spending time with her family and their two yellow
Labrador retrievers, travelling the world and exercising.

“An increasingly connected world — fueled by rapid advances in technology — is
driving massive workplace change that presents new challenges and
opportunities for HR leaders.”
