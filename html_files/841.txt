## Alumni Panel Offers Insights into the Corporate World

An alumni panel on building a corporate career with an accounting or finance
background helps first-year and sophomore students learn about the ample
opportunities in accounting and finance.

On November 7, 2017, Professor Chris Paisley moderated a newly-created panel
discussion titled “Building a Corporate Career with an Accounting/Financial
Background.” Five Santa Clara University alumni, all of whom majored in
accounting and began their careers at public accounting firms, returned to
campus to talk about their careers, career choices, and advice. About 80
students attended the event, of which 2/3 were first-year students and 1/3
were sophomores. The feedback was enthusiastically positive.

“Thank you. The students said it was GREAT! They really enjoyed it,” said
Theresa Strickland, whose Business 70 (Introduction to Business) students
attended.

Building on the positive response, Professor Paisley moderated a second panel
discussion for first-year students on October 30, 2018. This second panel
followed a similar format. About 110 students attended the 2018 panel, of
which about 80 percent were first-year students and 20 percent were
sophomores. The audience was more active in this second event, continually
asking questions through the entire event.

According to Professor Paisley, the goal of the panel is to expose students,
particularly first year students considering majoring in accounting or A&IS,
to opportunities in the business world beyond public accounting.

“Almost all accounting and A&IS majors are well aware of the public accounting
profession, as those firms do an exceptional job of marketing on college
campuses," said Professor Paisley. "But there are some students who forgo
public accounting, and even for those who enter public accounting, a
transition to the corporate world is commonplace. The panels are aimed at
describing career opportunities for students that major in accounting or A&IS
outside of public accounting.”

The alumni who contributed their time to these panels included,

#### November 2017 Panelists:

Tony Driver ’11, Sales Executive, Oracle  
Stephanie Han ’08, Revenue Operations Manager, Hortonworks  
Jay Maglione ’13, Product Manager, Nimble Collective  
Tanya Pastrano ’06, Controller, Munchery  
Bobby Shellworth ’13, Investment Banker, B of A / Merrill Lynch

#### October 2018 Panelists:

Veronica Bass ’11, Associate Finance Manager, Juniper Networks  
Scott Clark ’07, Controller, Lime  
Colleen James ’07, Accounting Manager, Biggs Cardosa Associates  
Shannon Wang ’12, Director of Finance, Santa Clara University  
Joseph Wattoo ’09, VP and Chief of Staff to COO, MGM Resorts Intl

Each of the panelists noted how their accounting background has proven helpful
to them in their chosen fields, with comments like, “Accounting is the
language of business, no matter what part of the business you are in.” Each
stayed afterwards to speak with students individually. We wish to give a
special shout out to Joey Wattoo, who flew in from Las Vegas to be on the
panel (and returned to Las Vegas after the event ended).

We plan to offer the panel again next fall. Advisory Board member Jack Lazar,
former CFO at Atheros and GoPro, has volunteered to moderate the 2019 event.
Former SCU accounting/A&IS majors who would be interested in participating in
future panels are encouraged to contact SCU’s Center for Accounting Research
and Education (CARE) Director Mike Calegari (mcalegari@scu.edu).
