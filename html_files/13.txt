Advising: A Shared Responsibility

You are responsible for knowing all academic regulations that affect your
program and for completing all degree requirements of the University, the
Leavey School of Business, and your major department. Failure to understand
these regulations and requirements does not relieve you of your
responsibility.

Please use this site as a resource to find all the advising-related material
you will need throughout your time as a Leavey School of Business student.

Contact the Undergraduate Business Programs Office (Lucas Hall, #115) for
information.

  * Peer Advisor
  * Faculty Advisor
  * Drahmann Center

#####  Your Academic Advisor

You are assigned a faculty member as your academic advisor to be your primary
resource for information and assistance on curricular planning and program
choice.

You must meet with your faculty advisor during the May advising period, unless
you have petitioned to graduate. (First-year students meet with assigned Peer
Advisors.)

#####  [Your LSB Peer
Advisor](https://www.scu.edu/business/undergraduates/advising/lsb-peer-
advising/)

Peer Advisors are a team of business students, trained and knowledgeable about
Business School requirements, who can show you how to use Santa Clara
University's many advising resources and materials, especially in your first
year.   You can contact [LSB-PeerAdvisor@scu.edu](mailto:LSB-
PeerAdvisor@scu.edu) to ask a question or schedule an appointment.
