  7. Tiffany Vu: Seeing Business in Nonprofits 

## Tiffany Vu: Seeing Business in Nonprofits

Tiffany reflects on how her business classes relate to how the Hispanic
Foundation of Silicon Valley operates.

![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/undergraduates/npi-and-lsb-community-
fellows/Tiffany-Vu-HeadShot-200x200.jpg)

After a quarter of working at the Hispanic Foundation of Silicon Valley
(HFSV), I found that  classes I have taken at Santa Clara relate to how the
HFSV operates. One key class that stands out to me is Constructing a Nonprofit
Organization. In that class, I learned about how nonprofits are different from
businesses, but in most cases working with other nonprofits increases the
success of both organizations. I drew this connection because the Family
College Success Center (FCSC) has had many different partnerships with other
nonprofits to create opportunities for preparing students for the SAT,
preparing students for college applications, and educating parents on how to
support their children. Not only do these programs exist, they also are
thriving. Recently, over 150 students signed up for a free SAT class run by
the FCSC. It was astounding to see such an increase in interest compared to
that of previous offerings.  Knowing that the HFSV is thriving and working to
achieve its mission statement is amazing.

In addition, all the team projects I have done at Santa Clara have helped
prepare me for my internship at the HFSV. I didn’t realize how important
effective communication was until I didn’t see the people I was working with
every single day. I was not always able to quickly receive updates, so having
my supervisors clearly define what they wanted from me and letting me know
what problems they wanted to tackle was eye opening. Having that, it made it
clear how I had to communicate with others, so they understood what I needed
from them or how my projects were progressing. I’m learning a lot at the HSFV
and I’m so incredibly happy that I get to work with them for the whole school
year.

Although I have learned a lot in the past quarter about what it is like to
work for a nonprofit, it’s time for me to pick up my speed and help make a
lasting impact on the organization using the skills I’ve learned at SCU.
