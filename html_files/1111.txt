Theresa Strickland is a key-industry merchandising strategist who's vast and
proven 25-year track record translates financial objectives into realistic

Strategizing for companies such as Macys, Pottery Barn, Cost Plus World

vertical integrations, creating product development, merchandising and
planning teams and an international sourcing organization that has continually
resulted in substantial volume growth.  She has also directly supervised
company activities including full profit and loss responsibility, development
of inventory, operating plans, sales plans, and her staff's execution of
approved merchandise plans and objectives.

Strickland is highly proficient at identifying and forecasting trends that are
developed into strategies for implementation of branded programs to maximize
the impact these trends have on fashion and consumerism. Her adept negotiating
abilities with both domestic and foreign markets, and proven analytical acumen
have made her a key go-to figure among Wall Street analysts, leading
educational institutions and national news agencies to name just a few.

Theresa Strickland originally received a BA in Fashion Design and
Merchandising from Chico State University, and an MBA from Leavey School of
Business, Santa Clara University.

In the following 25 years of management experience Ms. Strickland has excelled
in leading a variety of merchandising initiatives. She joined the Macy's West

President of Tabletop and House wares. As Senior Vice President of Pottery
Barn she helped to develop the retailer into one of the most successful multi-
channel branded retailers of today's environment.  At Cost Plus World Market
she served as Executive Vice President of Merchandising, Marketing, Design,
and Planning, and gained notoriety on Wall Street As Chief Home Design
Strategy and Branding Officer at Sears Holdings, Ms. Strickland has been
responsible for Sears, Kmart and Land's End's Home store strategy, branding
and design execution of all home merchandise where she successfully replaced
the Martha Stewart brand with a comprehensive, differentiating stable of
highly recognized National Brands.

Strong leadership skills allow Strickland to build consensus with management
and develop superior professional merchandising teams.

Whenever possible, she serves as the Professor of "Introduction to Business"
and "Leadership" classes at Santa Clara University.  She was awarded by the
Women in Leadership in the Board Room and the Executive Offices for Cost Plus
