  5. Study Materials 

![Sobrato Fountain Illustration](/media/leavey-school-of-
business/cepi/Sobrato-Fountain-360x246.png)

The CEPI updates all study materials on an annual basis. The study materials
for the 2019 exams will include a binder (supplied by the CEPI) and several
reference textbooks. Candidates are responsible for ensuring they are using
the current materials, so please check this page for updates on the 2019
materials list. [The 2019 Study Materials are now available through
NCEO.](https://www.nceo.org/pages/cep.php)

The CEP Study Binder contains the syllabi, reading lists, and reference
documents for all 3 exam levels. Therefore, candidates will receive one binder
per calendar year (i.e. if a candidate registers for the June exam and the
November exam in the same calendar year, they will not receive a binder for
November). The binder also contains required readings as outlined in the
syllabi.The binder is provided to Candidates of the program free of charge and
is sent to the address provided during registration.

Candidates are required to purchase additional reference textbooks.
Significant discounts have been negotiated for the required textbooks through
**[NCEO](http://www.nceo.org/pages/cep.php)
(<http://www.nceo.org/pages/cep.php>)**. It is the candidate's responsibility
to acquire the  correct textbooks. Because the textbooks are updated
frequently, CEPI recommends that candidates only buy the textbooks for the
level of the exam they are going to take. Confirmation of registration will
include ordering instructions.

The exams are open book and candidates must bring the required texts to the
exam.Please note that the NCEO sells both printed copies and digital versions
of the text books. **Only the printed versions of the text are allowed in the
exam.**   **Digital versions are NOT permitted in the exams under any
circumstances.  **Candidates may also bring notes to the testing center as
long as the notes are three-hole punched and included in the CEP Institute
study binder. Any papers that are not three-hole punched and included in the
binder will not be allowed at the testing session.

#### Additional Resources

##### Educational Resources

__

Course reviews and continuing education opportunities are often offered by
industry organizations such as those listed below.

**Although the CEP Institute makes this information available to candidates,
we do not endorse educational programs. The candidate must determine whether
the program is suitable for his/her needs.**  
  
Because educational offerings are so varied, consider asking the following
questions when evaluating a program:

  * What educational level is the curriculum (beginning, intermediate, advanced)?
  * How long does it take to complete the curriculum?
  * How much does the program cost? Does that amount include books, tests and other fees?
  * How are the courses scheduled? How often are courses offered?
  * Is the education program offered online or is it paper-based?
  * What are the credentials of the faculty?
  * Overall, how will this program prepare me to obtain the certified equity professional designation?
  * What is the pass rate of previous program participants?

  
Educational Service Providers: if you have a course geared to any of the three
levels of the CEP Institute program, or our continuing education requirement,
please contact [cepi@scu.edu](mailto:cepi@scu.edu) to be listed on this site.

#### Please note that all sample exams and sample questions are developed
independently by the individual educational service providers, not the CEPI.
The CEPI does not release sample questions or sample exams.
