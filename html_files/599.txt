##### Job Description

__

Trained Peer Advisors will work with assigned students throughout their first

the first year. Peer Advisors are trained to help teach students about their
advising and campus resources. Specific responsibilities include:

  * Become familiar with academic regulations and university and business core requirements as contained in the Leavey School of Business Advisor Manual and the University Bulletin, and other university resources for referral purposes.
  * Attend and participate in Peer Advisor Training for a full day on the Friday prior to the start of fall quarter. (Early move-in available for students will be living on campus)
  * Mandatory enrollment in BUSN 190 – LSB Peer Advisor practicum. This is a P/NP class which meets for an hour and a half on five Monday evenings (5:25-7:10 PM) of each quarter. We will utilize this time together to accomplish the following objectives: 
    * Practice and apply advising and interpersonal skills in the practice of developing a supportive relationship with group of first-year assigned advisees, as well as other business students who have questions about university and school of business policies, procedures, and graduation requirements.
    * Learn to understand and utilize resources in order to articulate university and school of business resources, policies, procedures, and core graduation requirements.
    * Learn about university and school of business advising structure, campus resources, and advising resources, and how to refer advisees appropriately.
    * Learn how to apply basic advising theory and concepts and the standards expected of professional advisors, and how to perform Peer Advisor record-keeping processes and procedures accurately and completely.
    * Learn about basic communication theories and practices, and develop/practice/utilize communication skills.
    * Learn how to complete and review a four-year course plan.
    * Contribute to a positive team dynamic and to the continued improvement of the LSB Peer Advising Program.
  * Develop a friendly relationship with your assigned group of 14-15 incoming first-year students. Communicate/meet with assigned students on regular basis during the first year, as a means of helping them adjust to college, navigate scheduling/registration issues, understand core requirements and academic regulations, and understand university resources.
  * Contact assigned students at least once during summer prior to arrival on campus.
  * Meet and/or communicate with assigned students at least once per quarter to find out how things are going and if they need any help/referral.
  * Be responsive to assigned students’ communication with you (this means answering promptly, typically within 24 hours).
  * Refer advisees to Faculty Advisor or other appropriate university faculty/staff or resources as needed.
  * Meet all advisees, in small groups of 1-3, during a pre-arranged two-week period in the fall quarter to discuss advisor contact information and advising resources, and help plan winter quarter schedules.
  * Participate in a Course Planning Workshop, open to all LSB students, in the winter quarter.
  * Perform 5 minute visit to 1-2 selected classes to advertise LSB Peer Advising in the winter quarter.
  * Meet individually with assigned advisees at least once during Annual Academic Advising period in May, to provide course planning and scheduling advice for sophomore year, fall quarter registration, and arrange for release of advising hold.
