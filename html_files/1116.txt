Rathi Murthy

#### Chief Technology Officer, Gap Inc.

Rathi Murthy serves as Chief Technology Officer of Gap Inc. where she leads
the engineering organization to build technology solutions and infrastructure
that power the company’s iconic brands: Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy,
Athleta and Intermix. In this role, she is driving transformation across the
organization’s technology backbone from the networks to data centers, cloud,
monitoring, application development, data integration, analytics and machine
learning and more.

Prior to joining Gap Inc. in 2016, Rathi served as SVP and CIO of Enterprise
Growth for American Express. There, she managed end-to-end platform
technology, infrastructure and operations, including delivery and
implementation of critical platforms, products and retail distribution
partnerships.  

Prior to AmEx, Rathi spent more than 20 years in increasingly senior
technology leadership roles at some of the industry’s leading technology
companies. While at EBay, she managed a team of more than 250 software
engineers to significantly improve site quality and speed to market. During
her tenure as an engineering leader at Yahoo!, she led a team to dramatically
reduce release cycle time and increase efficiency of quality assurance, build
and release management. She also spent time at Sun Microsystems and WebMD.  

In 2014, Rathi was named a Top Woman in Cloud Innovation and in 2015, she was
named one of the Most Influential Women in Payments. She holds a Master’s
degree in Computer Engineering from Santa Clara University.  

Outside of work, Rathi is committed to creating a stress-free society and
spends her weekends teaching the “Art of Living” in pursuit of this goal. She
and her husband have two grown children and love to travel the world together.
