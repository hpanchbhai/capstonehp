## Tiffany Vu: I Am Ready to Make a Bigger Difference

Tiffany reflects on her first few weeks at HFSV and being part of the the
Hispanic Foundation Ball.



![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/undergraduates/npi-and-lsb-community-
fellows/HFSV-Ball-360x270.JPG)

Thanks to the LSB Community Fellows Program, I intern at the Hispanic
Foundation of Silicon Valley (HFSV), a nonprofit organization dedicated to
improving the lives of Latinos/as in Silicon Valley by providing education and
leadership opportunities. For my fellowship, I work with  HFSV’s Family
College Success Center (FCSC) which focuses on providing and running programs
for low-income high school students.

After working for a few weeks at the HFSV, I’ve come away with a few key
impressions. Those who contribute their time to the HFSV are intensely
dedicated and extremely hardworking. So far, I’ve spent most of my time
learning how to use Salesforce and implementing my knowledge to further
integrate the system into the workings of HFSV. I am in charge of updating
information on Salesforce and helping the rest of the team learn how to use
it. I’m definitely learning a lot about how Salesforce works and how important
it is to keep information organized and in one place. In addition, I help with
the SAT classes by providing students with resources that they need. I’m
really excited to continue learning about providing education opportunities to
these high school students and getting to know them on an individual basis.

fellows/HFSV-360x480.jpeg)

The best surprise I have had so far is participating in the Hispanic
Foundation Ball that took place last weekend. It was amazing to see the crowd
of people that came for this event. Everyone was so passionate about HFSV’s
cause. Approximately 800 people came and they were all so excited to support
this organization so that it could keep providing opportunities to students. I
have never experienced anything like this in my life and I am so lucky to have
the chance to be a part of it. Even though I didn’t know many people in the
room, everybody was so welcoming and excited to talk to me because I was the
intern for HFSV. Getting to meet those who help make the event happen and
continuing to work with the staff who support HFSV’s mission continually
excites me and I am ready to make a bigger difference throughout the year.
