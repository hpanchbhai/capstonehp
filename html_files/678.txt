##### Business News

Louis Farrell in U.S. News & World Report’s International Student Counsel blog
provided “5 Tips for Studying STEM Subjects at U.S. Colleges,” with great
links to additional resources.

One of the tips we thought especially useful for international students
looking at Santa Clara University’s graduate programs was:

**"#5 Get hands-on training:** Many international students are eligible for up
to 12 months of optional practical training upon completion of a degree.
International students who receive a STEM-designated degree may qualify to
participate in an OPT STEM extension beyond the initial 12 months of OPT. This
enables them to remain in the U.S. for up to 29 months after graduation.

In order to qualify, you must have obtained a bachelor's, master's or doctoral
degree in a STEM program listed on the Department of Homeland Security's STEM-
designated degree program list, your employer must use the E-Verify program,
and you must not have already received a 17-month extension of OPT.
Additionally, you'll have to obtain work authorization through U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services and pay a filing fee."

With STEM-certification for the MS Business Analytics, MS Information Systems,
and MS Supply Chain Management & Analytics degrees, some SCU graduates may
extend their 12-month OPT experience for as much as 17 additional months!
