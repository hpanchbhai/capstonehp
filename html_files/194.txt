You can pursue one of two majors in the Accounting Department as an
undergraduate: Accounting or Accounting and Information Systems (AIS), jointly
offered with the Information Systems and Analytics Department (formerly OMIS).

You’ll take courses that prepare you for professional examinations that lead
to certifications, such as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or Certified
Management Accountant (CMA).  As a global citizen, you may want to study
abroad, and our majors are designed to allow you to do so during the fall
quarter of your junior year.

## Requirements

All students wishing to major in accounting or accounting and information
systems must complete both the [University core curriculum
requirements](/provost/core/ "Home » Home » Office of the Provost » Core
Curriculum") and the [Leavey School of Business core
requirements](/business/undergraduates/academics/lsb-core-curriculum/ "Home »
Home » Leavey School of Business » Undergraduates » Academics » LSB Core
Curriculum"), which include ACTG 11 and ACTG 12. We recommend that these two
classes are completed by the end of sophomore year.

In addition, students majoring in accounting or A&IS must complete the
following departmental requirements, respectively:

### Accounting Majors
