#### By Caroline Cerf

“Where is that again?” I have been repeatedly asked this question since
returning from my trip to Myanmar. To be honest, I didn’t truly realize it’s
place in the world until visiting. Located in the thick of Southeast Asia,
Myanmar, or Burma, as it is formerly known, is a country filled with rich
culture, an active environment, and plenty of humidity. With 11 students, 3
faculty members, and 1 Burmese tour guide, the Myanmar immersion program
offered both self-discovery and world insight that I had never before
experienced. As fellow program participant Kenley Wynne describes, “It was
total step outside my comfort zone,” but quickly remarks, “It was the best
risk I’ve taken as a Santa Clara student.”

Backpacking through rural Myanmar and visiting local industry along the way,
the Food and Agribusiness Institute crafted a trip that exposed me and other
students to a diverse array of agriculture, wildlife, and culture, with an
emphasis in sustainability. Traveling from region to region, we were also
introduced to the efforts of foreign aid and the newly established government.
Visiting a microfinance firm, current senior and economics major Marcus LeJay
expresses, “Visiting PGMF gave me insight into the financial foundation that
is required for local industry to develop—particularly in farming efforts.”
Local industry would follow us throughout our trip and was highlight for all
students. While in the Inle Lake region, my fellow peers and me had the
opportunity to participate in leg rowing—a type of fishing native to the lake.
After realizing how difficult it truly was and falling into lake, this
experience gave students a new appreciation for physical labor and the unique
culture of Myanmar.

Myanmar offered me more than just an educational experience—it provided me
with a refined career path, a global perspective, and friendships that I would
not have had without the immersion. As I reflect on my time at Santa Clara,
this experience will always have the most profound influence on my future.
