  5. Recruiting Events 

The SCU Accounting Association and the Accounting Department organize career
fairs for students interested in accounting careers.

#### Fall Meet-The-Firms Night

At the beginning of the Fall Quarter, the SCU Accounting Association hosts its
annual Meet-The-Firms (MTF) Night. This event unites SCU accounting and A&IS
students with potential employers who wish to hire them. Employers that attend
the event receive a resume booklet that includes resumes from all students
interested in pursuing a career in accounting. Students who wish to include
their resumes in the booklet must submit their resumes in a prescribed format
to the SCU Accounting Association by a deadline that occurs a few days before
the event. In the weeks before MTF Night, the [SCU Accounting
Association](/business/accounting/beyond-the-classroom/accounting-association/
"Home » Home » Leavey School of Business » Accounting » Beyond the Classroom »
Accounting Association") organizes workshops to help students best prepare for
the event. For news about the most recent MTF Night, see [SCU’s Annual Meet-
The-Firms Night](/business/accounting/news-stories/scus-annual-meet-the-firms-
night.html "Home » Home » Leavey School of Business » Accounting » News
Stories » 18/10/15:  Meet the Firms 2018") in News & Events.

#### Sophomore Accounting / A&IS Career Fair

During the Winter Quarter, the Accounting Department holds an annual Sophomore
Accounting / A&IS Career Fair. The goal of this career fair is to introduce
students to accounting firms who will be offering sophomore summer leadership
programs, junior summer internships, and other opportunities.  Summer
leadership programs are a great way to get firsthand experience at a firm and
often lead to an offer for a future summer internship.  In addition, some
firms may interview sophomores during on-campus interviews for summer
internships following their junior year. The Sophomore Accounting / A&IS
Career Fair is a great opportunity to get a jump start on these internships.
