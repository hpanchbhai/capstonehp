# Digital Signs

  5. Digital Signs 

Digital signs in Lucas Hall are intended to be a communication resource for
Leavey School of Business students, staff, faculty, alumni, and guests of the
School and University.

_Internal LSB digital sign request should be submitted via the Marketing Needs
list. Your MARCOM team representative will review your submission and contact
you about your request._

_For student and Student Organization signs within LSB, please read the
guidelines and use the templates and submission form below. All submissions
will go through the LSB MARCOM approval process before being displayed._

_For requests outside LSB please submit to the Academic Technology site here:_  
 _<https://www.scu.edu/is/academic-technology/graphics-and-digital-signage/>_

* * *

Posting on the digital signs is available to communicate about events or news
of interest to the SCU business community. Twelve high-resolution digital
displays are located throughout Lucas Hall; three of these display in a
vertical (portrait) format and the rest are displayed horizontally
(landscape). Content for the digital signs is supervised by the Business
School Dean's Office Marketing & Communications team. Display priority will be
given to signs submitted from within the School of Business, though non-
business-related signs may run at the discretion of the Dean's Office.

Signs run in a looping playlist with each one appearing for approximately 12
seconds. They will run for a maximum of 14 days, however, if you would like to
advertise for an event longer than that you can submit a second sign that
looks significantly different.

Content must be submitted to the Business School Marketing & Communications
office at least 1 week prior to the desired run-date by a recognized
University entity for approval. The School of Business reserves the right to
edit text and/or design of slides to comply with University and School
standards.

#### Digital Sign Checklist

Before you start the form ([here »](/business/about/lucashall/digital-
signs/uploadform/ "Home » Home » Leavey School of Business » About LSB » Lucas
Hall » Digital Signs » Digital Signage Upload Form")), make sure:

  1. **Is the sign in the right format?  
** We accept .jpg, .png or .pptx formats. You are welcome to use either of our
PowerPoint templates (.pptx) provided above.  
 _Note: If you submit a .jpg or .png that doesn't follow School or University
guidelines listed below, we reserve the right not to run it._  
  

  2. **Is the sign in the right size?  
** The above templates are already sized correctly, but:  
Horizontal signs measure 1920 pixels wide by 1080 high  
Vertical signs measure 1080 wide by 1920 high  
 _Note: If only one size is submitted, we may opt not to run the sign on the
other monitors.  
  
_

  3. **Is your sign ADA compliant?** _  
_All campus events _must_ include the following ADA statement with a name and
email or phone number to contact for accommodation requests.  
  
 _"In compliance with ADA/504, please direct your accommodation requests to
[NAME] at [EMAIL or PHONE]."_  
  
 _Note: If an event sign is submitted without the required ADA text it will
not be posted.  
  
_

  4. **Is the sign announcing an event less than one week from now?  
** Due to the heavy volume of sign requests, we cannot guarantee less than a
72-hour turnaround. We request you submit your material at least one week
before your sign is to go up — and in fairness to your audience, you should
run the sign two weeks prior to the event!  
  

  5. **Does the sign promote a commercial venture or is it from a non-SCU-related organization?  
** Business School editors reserve the right to deny any posting deemed
inappropriate for the purposes of digital signage (see above introductory
statement).
