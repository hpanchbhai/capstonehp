About **  
**

![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/finance-/scu-finance-1-360x250.png)

The Santa Clara University Finance Association is committed to progressing
members’ network connections and overall  development of financial principals,
technical skills and mentality in order to prepare for successful careers.
Through the use of influential guest speakers, panel discussions, and
community engagement, we attempt to provide the best resources and knowledge
available to further expand and strengthen the relationships of the SCU
finance student body.

Message from the President:

This year we are excited announce the Finance Association here at Santa Clara.
Throughout the year we will invite leaders with financial backgrounds to speak
to the organization and invite students to form connections with both alumni
and potential employers. The Association will have meetings on a regular basis
that will be student led, focusing on relevant topics that are educational for
students of all experience levels. I look forward to meeting all members and
growing the organization here at Santa Clara.

Bradley Sheffield  
President, Finance Association at SCU
