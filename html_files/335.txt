Terri L. Griffith focuses her teaching, consulting, and research on how new
and old technologies, organizational practices, and people’s skills can be
woven together to achieve strategic and performance targets today -- and how
to learn from the results so tomorrow's performance is even better. Most
recently her work addresses how we best integrate artificial intelligence and
new organizational designs into our work. She offers her framework for these
strategies in her award-winning book, The Plugged-In Manager: Get in Tune with
Your People, Technology, and Organization to Thrive.

Professor Griffith’s M.S. and Ph.D. are from Carnegie Mellon University. Her
B.A. is from U.C. Berkeley. She is one of the 100 honored members of the 2012
Silicon Valley Women of Influence. She and her colleagues have received grants
from the National Science Foundation, Tekes, the Society for Information
Management’s Advanced Practices Council, and the United States Information
Agency.

She teaches in the undergraduate, graduate, and executive programs at SCU. She
has served as Associate Dean, Department Chair, and at the University-level,
Program Director for Innovation and Organizational Change in the Center for
Science, Technology, and Society; as well as chair and chair-elect of the
University Coordinating Committee.

Before coming to Santa Clara University, Professor Griffith was on the
faculties of Washington University, St. Louis and the University of Arizona.
She has also held visiting positions at UC Berkeley; Purdue University;
Northwestern University; the Melbourne School of Business; and the Sasin
Graduate Institute of Business Administration in Bangkok, Thailand.

She is a member of the Academy of Management and INFORMS, associate editor for
Group Decision and Negotiation, past senior editor for Organization Science,
as well as a past associate editor for MIS Quarterly. Her research has
appeared in these journals as well as Information Systems Research,
Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, Academy of Management
Review, and other top peer-reviewed journals. Her paper with colleague John
Sawyer, Multilevel knowledge and team performance, was a finalist for the
paper of the year in Journal of Organizational Behavior. She also publishes in
the Wall Street Journal, the Harvard Business Review and MIT Sloan Management
Review blogs and other global media outlets.

Professor Griffith has over 25 years of working with leaders from companies
large and small, global and local, traditional and cutting-edge. Some of these
include: Abengoa, Bank of America, Central Soya, Cisco, Constellation
Research, Cypress Semiconductor, Finnair, General Motors, GlaxoSmithKline,
Greyhound Financial, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, Inc., Oracle,
Pioneer Hybrid, MentorNet, Sonera, and Syngenta. She is passionate about
bringing real-world examples to her classes, workshops, and speaking.
