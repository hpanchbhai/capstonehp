## U.S. News and World Report Ranks Leavey School of Business Top 100
Nationally

SCU’s Leavey School of Business ranked No. 62 nationally with individual
business programs ranking in the top 40.

**SANTA CLARA, Calif.** Sept. 12, 2018—The Leavey School of Business at Santa
Clara University once again ranks among the top 100 business schools in the
nation, according to _U.S. News and World Report_ ’s [2019 Best Business
Programs ranking](https://premium.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business-
overall). The School, coming in at number 62, climbed two spots from last
year’s No. 64 ranking.

Individual business school programs also placed highly in the recent ranking:

  * [Management Information Systems](https://premium.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business-management-information-systems): #18
  * [Entrepreneurship](https://premium.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business-entrepreneurship): #23
  * [Accounting](https://premium.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business-accounting): #37

“To see the Leavey School of Business recognized on a national level once
again reinforces the work that we do,” said Caryn Beck-Dudley, dean of the
Leavey School of Business. “It speaks to the strength of our faculty, staff,
and student body, and I couldn’t be more proud. We are thrilled to be part of
a University that is committed to excellence at all levels and we share in the
celebration of those who help make Santa Clara thrive.”

Santa Clara University came in at [No. 1 Regional University in the
West](/news-and-events/press-releases/2018/september-2018/us-news--world-
report-ranks-santa-clara-university-no-1-in-the-western-region.html "Home »
Home » News & Events » Press Releases » 2018 » September 2018 » USNews 2019
Ranking"), earning a perfect overall score of 100 out of 100. The University
was once again ranked No. 1 in [Best Colleges for
Veterans](https://premium.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/regional-
universities-west/veterans), ranked No. 6 for [Undergraduate
Teaching](https://premium.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/regional-
universities-west/undergraduate-teaching), No. 10 for “[Most Innovative
School](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/regional-universities-
west/innovative),” and No. 15 in [Best Value
Schools](https://premium.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/regional-
universities-west/best-value).

The “2019 Best Colleges” rankings analyzes 312 “national” and 646 “regional”
universities—including Santa Clara University. Regional universities are
defined as offering a full range of undergraduate programs and master’s
degrees, but few doctoral programs. The western region, where Santa Clara
University is located, covers 140 master’s level universities from Colorado to
the West Coast, including those in Texas.

The “Best Colleges” rankings can be found on the _U.S. News & World Report_
website. The 2019 print edition of the “Best Colleges” guidebook will be on
newsstands Oct. 16 and can be purchased online at USNews.com.
