Jesuit Business Education has been a mainstay in the Graduate Management
arena. MBA students and alumni from Jesuit schools receive an education that
is known for its commitment to ethics, integrity and competency. The Jesuit
MBA Network (JEBNET) is an organization of Graduate Business School leaders
from Jesuit universities in the United States, Europe, Asia, and South
America.

These leaders gather twice annually to share ideas, best practices and to
explore ways to support the students at their respective institutions.  Since
its inception, the Leavey School of Business has been a part of this network
and has collaborated with many of the member schools to implement new and
innovative initiatives for its MBA students.

MBA students enrolled at member schools have the unique advantage of being
able to transfer to any institution without sacrificing units or time to
complete their degree. Along with the transfer benefit, students can also
participate in select study abroad programs and networking events.  Alumni
from member institutions have also benefitted from regional Jesuit networking
events and post-MBA programs.

> Welcome JEBNET Members! On behalf of the Leavey School of Business, we are
