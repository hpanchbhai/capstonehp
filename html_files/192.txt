## SCU's Part-Time MBA Program Ranked No. 25 in the Country

Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business part-time MBA program is
among the top in the nation in U.S.News & World Report’s “Best Graduate
Schools 2018” ranking.

**SANTA CLARA, Calif.** , March 14, 2017 — _U.S. News & World Report_ magazine
has ranked the part-time Master of Business Administration program at Santa
Clara University’s Leavey School of Business No. 25 in the nation, out of 301
part-time MBA programs, based on peer evaluations and the caliber of entering
students. This year’s ranking, up from No. 37, places the Leavey School of
Business 2nd in the Bay Area, 2nd among Jesuit Schools, and 4th in California.

“This fantastic news reflects all of the hard work that my team has
accomplished to make our MBA program the best that it can be,” said Caryn
Beck-Dudley, dean of the Leavey School of Business. “Our goal is to create the
future business leaders of tomorrow, leveraging the very best of Silicon
Valley so our graduates leave SCU with the tools and skills employers are
demanding today.”

These rankings come after a significant overhaul of the part-time MBA program
last year. Changes made to meet the evolving needs of today’s working
professionals brought about a program that is nimbler, more-flexible, Silicon
Valley-focused, and can be completed in two years. The new curriculum pulls
from the best practices of Silicon Valley and of innovative global business
models, giving MBA students the tools that they need to run the next
generation of leading companies.

“We are honored to be among the top 25 part-time MBA programs in the country,”
said Toby McChesney, senior assistant dean of graduate business programs at
the Leavey School of Business. “We are very proud of our strong admissions
numbers, our committed and professional student body, and the role we play in
helping our students advance their careers.”

**About the Leavey School of Business**  
The Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University began in 1923, and was
one of the first business schools in the country to receive national
accreditation. Its undergraduate business, MBA and M.S. programs are
consistently ranked among the top in the nation by _BusinessWeek, U.S. News &
World Report, Princeton Review_, and others. The curriculum at all levels
emphasizes the leadership role of business in creating prosperity within an
ethical framework, as well as business responsibilities for social justice and
sustainability in the global marketplace. For more information, see
