Abstract:

Economics students have been shown to exhibit more selfishness than other
students. Because the literature identifies the impact of long-term exposure
to economics instruction (e.g., taking a course), it cannot isolate the
specific course content responsible; nor can selection, peer effects, or other
confounds be properly controlled for.  In a laboratory experiment, we use a
within- and across-subject design to identify the impact of brief, randomly-
assigned economics lessons on behavior in the ultimatum game (UG), dictator
game (DG), prisoner’s dilemma (PD), and public-goods game (PGG). We find that
a brief lesson that includes the assumptions of self-interest and strategic
considerations moves behavior toward traditional economic rationality in UG,
PD, and DG. Despite entering the study with higher levels of selfishness than
others, subjects with prior exposure to economics instruction have similar
training effects. We show that the lesson reduces efficiency and increases
inequity in the UG. The results demonstrate that even brief exposure to
commonplace neoclassical economics assumptions measurably moves behavior
toward self-interest.
