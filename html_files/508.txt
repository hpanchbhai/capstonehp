#### Studying Abroad

Our program is designed to allow accounting and A&IS; majors to study abroad
during the fall quarter of their junior year without falling behind in their
required upper division accounting classes. We recommend that study abroad
students take ACTG 130 in the winter quarter of their junior year.
