Steve Olson

#### Distinguished Lecturer & Assistant Director, Executive Education,
University of Tennessee - Chattanooga

Dr. Steve Olson has been a pioneering leader in executive education for more
than 25 years. He has trained and coached more than 2,000 executives in the
United States, Europe, and Latin America. His teaching specialties include
Innovation, Leadership, and Ethics, and he is widely published in leading
academic journals including the Harvard Business Review. He has taught
innovation, leadership and ethics in MBA, Executive MBA and Executive
Education programs. Steve has also done extensive consulting work with major
corporations as well as local and international non-profit groups.

In 2012, Steve led the team that created the nation's first Certified
Professional Innovator Program for business executives. He wrote and produced
the world's first Digital Badge mobile learning programs in business
innovation (2016) and leadership excellence (2017). When combined with face-
to-face sessions, digital badges can deliver much of the core content of
traditional programs more efficiently and in a more flexible and engaging
format. His work has been featured in USA Today, Newsweek, and Scientific
American.

In between his tours in higher education, Steve co-founded and managed
Generative Consulting (1999-2007), a leadership development firm that
delivered leadership development programs in partnership with the Great Place
to Work Institute and its Fortune *100 Best Companies to Work For* project.
Several of Steve's clients appeared regularly on the Fortune list, including
the #1 Best Place to Work in America (2001).

Steve earned a Masters and honors from Yale University and a Ph.D. from Emory
University, where his dissertation received the International Leadership
Association's "Best Dissertation Award" (2007).
