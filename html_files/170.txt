think they know networking, but Jaymin will show you how to stand out among
top caliber candidates by networking like a Rockstar! Jaymin has presented The
Rockstar Approach to packed rooms across the US, and internationally at
schools like Harvard, Wharton, Stanford and the London School of Economics. Go
beyond that 8.5’ x 11’ piece of paper called a resume-Jaymin presents the must
do’s and what-not-to-do’s of networking to build meaningful and lasting
personal relationships in professional settings and achieve your career goals.

it’s your weekly team stand-up or a massive all-hands presentation to the
entire company, you need to be able to confidently articulate your thoughts in

view", how to “think on your feet” other best practices and exercises that
