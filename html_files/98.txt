# How to Complete Your Course Plan

![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/illustrations-mp/Air-
Ballons-360x200-360x200.png)

We have everything that you will need on this page for course planning.  A
step-by-step guide that walks you through the 5 most imporatnt steps that you
need to complete, and all of the resources to answer your questions or
concerns.

##### A Step-By-Step Guide

__



**1.** Print out an eCampus Transcript Degree Audit

_From your  [eCampus Student Center](https://www.scu.edu/ecampus)_  
Choose the "Academics" tile  
Choose "Unof_Transcript + Degree Audit" for Report Type  
Click on "Go"

**2.** Fill out a  [Requirements
Checklist](https://www.scu.edu/business/undergraduates/advising/course-
planning/requirement-checklists/ "Home » Home » Leavey School of Business »
Undergraduates » Advising » Course Planning » Requirement Checklists") using
your transcription and degree audit (This step is only necessary if you want a
one-page summary)

**3.** Transfer all the courses with blank boxes on the Requirements
Checklist, or all the "not satisfied" courses on your Degree Audit, to the
[Course Planning
Worksheet](https://www.scu.edu/business/undergraduates/advising/course-
planning/requirement-checklists/ "Home » Home » Leavey School of Business »
Undergraduates » Advising » Course Planning » Requirement Checklists")

_**Use**  _tentative course schedules to anticipate which quarter courses will
likely be offered

_**Verify**_  you will meet all prerequisites BEFORE the quarter you plan to
take a particular class

_**Enter**  _placeholders for required major courses if you haven't declared a
major:

_Accounting_   7 - 8 courses  
 _Accounting and Information Systems_   12 courses  
 _Economics_   7 courses  
 _Finance_   5 - 6 courses  
 _Management_   5 courses  
 _Marketing_   5 courses  
 _Operations Management & Information Systems_  7 courses

Leavey Scholars should use the [Leavey Scholars Course Planning worksheet
(XLS)](https://www.scu.edu/media/leavey-school-of-business/undergraduates/lsp-
course-planning-worksheet-6-1-15.xls)

**4.**  Total the number of units

Confirm that there are 175 units total, of which 60 units are upper division
(courses number 100 and above)

**5.** Meet with your faculty advisor (or Drahmann Center advisor) to have
your course plan reviewed.

##### Resources to Answer Your Questions

__

[LSB Peer Advisors](https://www.scu.edu/business/undergraduates/advising/lsb-
peer-advising/ "Home » Home » Leavey School of Business » Undergraduates »
Advising » LSB Peer Advising") can help you fill these out or do an initial
check after you have completed the plan. Once you have fully completed your
course plan you should make an appointment with your assigned faculty advisor
to review the plan. If you plan to double-major or add minors to your Course
Plan, you should review it with a Drahmann Center Advisor (408-554-4318) who
is best equipped to advise across Schools.

[Online
resources](https://www.scu.edu/business/undergraduates/advising/resources/
"Home » Home » Leavey School of Business » Undergraduates » Advising »
Resources") are available throughout the Business Undergraduate site,
including Requirement Checklists, Prerequisite Lists, and links to upcoming
quarter schedules.

Tentative Course Schedules are in back of the [Deadlines & Registration
Information Booklet](https://www.scu.edu/registrar/).

Prerequisites for Classes are in the course descriptions in the [Undergraduate
Bulletin](https://www.scu.edu/bulletin/undergraduate-bulletin/).  A listing of
prerequisites for all business classes can be found
[here](https://www.scu.edu/business/undergraduates/advising/course-
planning/prerequisites/).
