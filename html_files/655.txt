* * *

Dr. Karla Callahan initially joined SCU as an adjunct lecturer teaching the
undergraduate class "Science, Information Technology, Business and Society",
OMIS 34. This year in addition to teaching, Dr. Callahan takes the position as
Dean’s Executive Professor which includes responsibility for developing and
refining the graduate and three undergraduate curricula.

Karla is the founder and CEO of Vizyontech Imaging, developing an ultrasound
product to make medical imaging easy, affordable and available to even the
most underprivileged areas of the world. Dr. Callahan was the designer and
author of the patent successfully issued in 2014. She previously held
executive positions at Texas Instruments, Cypress Semiconductor and American
Microsystems where she worked on new product innovation, managed large
international organizations using a wide variety of enterprise software,
optimized complex supply chains and evolved critical management information
systems.

Dr. Callahan has founded three companies. Her previous start-up company,
United Silicon Structures, won a major product contract with Boeing 767 & 777
aircraft for an integrated circuit design for airplane data and control
safety, later acquired by a European company.

Dr. Callahan earned her Ph.D. (2004) and MS in Engineering Management at the
University of Missouri, and BS Chemistry from the School of Mines and
