Aimee Brown

#### Mentor to Social Entrepreneurs, Miller Center Global Social Benefit
Institute

Aimee works with the Miller Center’s Global Social Benefit Institute at Santa
Clara University preparing social entrepreneurs for impact investment, and
serves on corporate, civic, and non-profit boards. In both cases, due to her
expertise in starting up, growing, and running a successful business, she
engages organizations on how to align their practices with their strategic
vision to deliver immediate and long-term results. She communicates and
collaborates with Board members, the executive/management team and investors
to achieve action plans that grow revenue, overcome operational challenges and
minimize financial and regulatory risks.

Over her 30-year career, she has worked on funding complex infrastructure
projects as well as financing public-private partnerships. She started her
career at Goldman Sachs and left to become a founding principal at Artemis
Capital Group, a national, women-owned investment banking firm which was
successfully sold. During this time, she served on the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board, the regulatory body that has authority over municipal
securities activities for banks and securities firms. She also served on the
National Association of Securities Dealers Fixed Income Committee, including
one year as Chair and the Board of Directors for the California Public
Securities Association.

Aimee currently serves on the Treasurer’s Oversight Committee for the City and
County of San Francisco and previously she was Chair of the Revenue Bond
Oversight Committee for the Public Utilities Commission of San Francisco.
Other public affiliations include for the State of California serving as a
Commissioner of the California  
Intercity High Speed Rail Transportation Commission and the State of
California Debt Advisory Commission’s Technical Advisory Committee. Aimee
served as Treasurer of the Board, Chair of the Finance Committee and on the
Executive Committee for bay.org, the Board of Angel Island Conservancy and the
Board of Fellows for Trinity College in Hartford, CT, her alma mater.

Aimee was on the Board of a Non-depository Bank for 4 years and served as
Chair of the Audit Committee where she oversaw the development of audit policy
and internal audit function. Aimee is a national and San Francisco chapter
member of the Women’s President Organization, a national member of Women
Impacting Public Policy and Women’s Forum West. Aimee holds a Master of
Management in Public Management and Business from the Kellogg Graduate School
of Management at Northwestern University.
