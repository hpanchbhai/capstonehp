## Global Fellows FAQ

![Global Fellows Students in Bolivia](/media/leavey-school-of-
business/undergraduates/global-fellows/IMG_3743-759x422.jpg)



**The Global Fellows program** is SCU’s premier professional internship
opportunity. Every year, the program recruits exceptional students to travel
all over the world and participate in a 6 to 8 week internship with an NGO or
business. It provides students with leadership development and an
understanding of the increasing level of globalization in our world.

The goal of the Global Fellows Program is to foster global citizens of
competence, conscience, and compassion through an emphasis on service,
academics, and leadership.

##### Is Global Fellows open to any major?

__



Yes! We strive to have a group of diverse skill sets and we encourage students
from all majors to apply.



##### What school year do I have to be in order to apply to be a Global
Fellow?

__

The Global Fellows program is only open to sophomores and juniors. If you are
a first year student we still encourage you to come to our events (such as the
open house) and look through the application.



##### What are the commitments of being a Global Fellows?

__

The Global Fellows program beings with a leadership practicum in the spring.
This 2-unit class engages students to think critically about global
citizenship and what it means to be a leader in the 21st century. The class
also includes extensive research of the Fellows’ placement countries and helps
to provide context for the summer international work experience.  During the
summer, students will spend 6 to 8 weeks in an NGO or business that embodies
the ideal of global leadership.

Fellows are also required to participate on another 2-unit class and a retreat
when classes start again in the Fall. This allows students to bring back their
experiences on campus, as well as digest their experience, compare it with
others, and analyze their learnings.

##### Can I do study abroad and also participate in Global Fellows

__

Yes, many of our students combine a Global Fellows summer with their Fall
study abroad experience.  Students who study abroad will make up for missed
assignments and retreat in the winter.

##### Does Global Fellows fulfill the ELSJ requirement?

__

**All of the placements fulfill the ESLJ requirement except for Franklin
Templeton, India.**

##### Where will I be living during the summer internship?

__

Each placement has different housing options. Some of them are home stays,
others offer private residencies or apartments. You can find more information
about each placement here. We also highly encourage you to talk with past
fellows about their living situation and ask questions!

##### What placements are offered this year?

__

This year, the Global Fellows Program will be in Bolivia, The Gambia, India,
Morocco, Rwanda and Ghana. To find out more about the placements offered in
each country click [here](/business/undergraduates/community/global-
fellows/placements/ "Home » Home » Leavey School of Business » Undergraduates
» Community & Campus Involvement » Global Fellows Internship » Placements").

##### Who decides where each student is placed?

__

You will have a chance to select your top 3 placements in your application. We
will do our best to ensure that your skills match the organizations’ needs and
will place you accordingly.  We strive to place you within your top 3 choices.

#####  Will I travel alone or with a group?

__

All fellows travel in either pairs or groups.
