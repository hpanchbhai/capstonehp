Admissions Information

![Woman's face](/media/leavey-school-of-business/caap/SM-Outline-
AdobeStock_112357205-350x331.png)

Santa Clara University's Silicon Valley Executive Center processes all CAAP
Program applications, and will communicate with students as quickly as
possible regarding application status. Applications are typically processed
within two to four weeks of receipt.

If you have any questions about your application, please email
[caap@scu.edu](mailto:caap@scu.edu) or call 408-554-4522.

##### Application Deadlines

__

We process applications and make acceptance decisions on a rolling basis. We
encourage applicants to apply early in the application cycle.

The Summer and Weekend application will open in January.

To register for a free CAAP Information Session (held monthly January through
August) [click here](https://www.scu.edu/business/caap/caap-info/).

##### Requirements

__

Applicants must have a bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited U.S.
college or university or a foreign equivalent (see [International
Students](/business/caap/prospective/admissions/#d.en.343962 "Home » Home »
Leavey School of Business » Certificate of Advanced Accounting Proficiency »
Prospective Students » Admissions Information » ACC1-4: International
Students") below). Applicants must submit an official transcript showing
receipt of their bachelor’s or master's degree. If your undergraduate or
graduate GPA is below 2.5, you must submit a statement of purpose and a letter
of recommendation in addition to transcripts.

##### Schedule

__

**Weekend Program**

Students in the weekend program take the courses from September through June
on either Saturdays (cohort 1) or Sunday (cohort 2). Students meet in class on
either Saturday or Sunday (not both) for eight hours each day: from 9AM - 6PM
with a one-hour break. Each course lasts about five weeks.

**Summer Program**

Students in the summer program take 45 quarter units of accounting courses
from June through September, meeting every weekday from 9AM-1PM (cohort 1) or
2:30PM-6:30PM (cohort 2). Each course lasts eight or nine consecutive days,
Monday-Friday. You can count on several hours of homework each night. Because
of the intense nature of the courses, we recommend that students do not work
while enrolled in this program.

##### International Students

__

The Certificate of Advanced Accounting Proficiency (CAAP) program is offered
via a part-time weekend schedule.  As such, international students are
ineligible to apply since US Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
requirements for international students mandate full-time enrollment in
academic programs. Visas cannot be issued for the Summer CAAP program.

The Leavey School of Business offers graduate programs which may serve the
needs of international students and for which they may be eligible.
International students interested in these programs should contact the
Graduate Business area at [gradbusiness@scu.edu](mailto:gradbusiness@scu.edu)
or [408-554-4539](tel:408-554-4539).

International transcripts must be evaluated by any California Board of
Accountancy approved agency found at
<https://www.dca.ca.gov/cba/applicants/foreign.pdf>. Evaluations must show a
U.S. bachelor’s degree equivalency and final cumulative grade point average.

Students who completed their formal education at a non-English speaking
institution must complete the TOEFL exam and submit the results with their
application.

A minimum level of English proficiency is required to study in the Certificate
of Advanced Accounting Proficiency (CAAP) program. To be considered for
admission,a student must submit TOEFL exam results with a minimum score of 90
(iBT). English courses completed at a community college or U.S. university do
not fulfill this requirement.

You are exempt from this requirement if you are from a country whose official
language is English or if your Bachelor's (or Master's, if applicable) degree
was completed at an institution in which English is the primary language of
instruction. However, all applicants may be asked to provide further evidence
of English proficiency as needed and you may be required to speak with the
program director for advanced counseling prior to an admissions decision.

_Note:   Applicants whose native language is English need not submit TOEFL
scores._

You should have your scores sent to Santa Clara University – Leavey School of
Business.
