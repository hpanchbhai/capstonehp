Kris James Mitchener is the Robert and Susan Finocchio Professor of Economics
at Santa Clara University, Research Associate at the National Bureau of
Economic Research (NBER) and the Centre for Competitive Advantage and the
Global Economy (CAGE), and Research Fellow at the Centre for Economic and
Policy Research (CEPR) and CESifo.

His research focuses on economic history, international economics,
macroeconomics, and political economy. He is a leading expert on the history
of financial crises, and is currently researching how banking crises
redistribute risk in financial networks distribute and can amplify the size of
downturns through balance-sheet effects. His current research in international
macroeconomics analyzes how commodity-price shocks affect countries'
commitments to pegged exchange rates as well as the effects of monetary policy
shocks on output and inflation. In political economy, he is working on
understanding how financial instruments can be designed to reduce conflict and
enable political and economic modernization, as was the case with the issuance
of samurai bonds in Meiji Japan.

Professor Mitchener's prior research on sovereign debt crisis explores how the
adoption of fixed exchange-rate influences risk spreads and how sovereign debt
claims have been enforced historically. His path-breaking study on the Great
Depression, published in 2003, demonstrated how the size of credit booms
influences the severity of the economic downturns. Prior to his current
position, he was professor of economics at the University of Warwick, and from
2009-11, he was the W. Glenn Campbell and Rita-Ricardo Campbell Hoover
National Fellow at Stanford University. He has held visiting positions at the
Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis and San Francisco, UCLA,
Waseda University, Queens University (Canada), and CREi at Universitat Pompeu
Fabra. He is editor of Explorations in Economic History and presently serves
on the editorial boards of the Financial History Review, Cliometrica,
Economics, and Cambridge University Press. He received his B.A. and Ph.D. from
the University of California, Berkeley.
