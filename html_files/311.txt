Najafi earned a Master of Science in Industrial Engineering from Sharif
University of Technology (Iran) in 2005.

Dr. Najafi’s research interests center on Service Operations. His current
research is in two specific areas. The first considers how the operational
decision-making of a firm changes by consumers’ loss-averse behavior, while
the second provides analytic tools to assist web publishers with pricing and
the revenue management of display ads in online advertising. Dr. Najafi has a
number of papers related to his research and is preparing several others for
submission to peer-reviewed publications. He has also been invited to present
his works at professional conferences and universities in North America and
Europe.

Dr. Najafi has teaching experience, gained as part of his postdoctoral
fellowship at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. In the
Fall, 2012, semester, Dr. Najafi taught the fulltime core MBA “Statistics for
Management” course to 64 students in the MBA program. Despite its challenging
content the course received glowing student reviews where he won a Rotman MBA
Teaching Award. In the Winter, 2013, semester, Dr. Najafi also taught a
graduate-level “Queueing Theory” course to Master and PhD students in the
Industrial Engineering department.
