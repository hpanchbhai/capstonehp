## Leavey School of Business Undergraduate Program Ranked No. 16 in the Nation

LSB's undergraduate business program has been ranked among the best in the
nation by Poets&Quants; for Undergrads.

**SANTA CLARA, Calif.** , Dec. 5, 2017—Santa Clara University’s Leavey School
of Business has been named No. 2 in California and No. 16 nationally in the
[Best Undergraduate Business
Schools](https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/2017/12/05/poetsquants-best-
undergraduate-business-programs-2017/) ranking by _Poets &Quants for
Undergrads_. In one of the most comprehensive assessments of undergraduate
business programs, the study ranked 82 business programs in the United States
based on admissions standards, academic experience, and employment outcomes.

“Our undergraduate business program provides an excellent, well-rounded
business education, which prepares our students for the challenges they will
face in their careers and makes us a destination of choice for Silicon Valley
companies looking to hire,” said Caryn Beck-Dudley, dean of the Leavey School
of Business. “We are extremely proud to be ranked among the top in the
nation.”

The editors of _Poets &Quants_ said the 82 business schools in the ranking are
“all extraordinary, each in the top 10 percent to 15 percent of accredited
institutions.” Among the top 25, the findings revealed that the average total
compensation, including starting salary and bonuses, for graduates is $70,370.
Robust starting salaries allow students to get a head start in the highly
competitive job market and begin payments on student loan debt.  

“This is THE most thorough data-driven study of undergraduate business
education ever undertaken," said John A. Byrne, founder and editor-in-chief of
_Poets &Quants for Undergrads_. "At a time when parents and students are
confronting ever increasing tuition bills and levels of debt, the return-on-
investment of a degree is more important than ever. We measure those returns
and it's no wonder that more parents are encouraging their children to major
in business. The best business schools are a no-brainer investment because
they are reporting record or near-record starting salaries and job placement
for their graduates. What we've produced is an invaluable resource for
students trying to make smart decisions about where to get the best education
for a successful career.”
