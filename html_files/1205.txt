## Madi Clelland: Feeling Ready to Take on More!

Madi discusses her internship tasks at Cristo Rey San Jose High School.

![LSB Community Fellows 2017-18](/media/leavey-school-of-
business/undergraduates/npi-and-lsb-community-fellows/maddie-300x300.jpg)

Through the LSB Community Fellows program, I have been lucky enough to intern
in the Corporate Work Study office at Cristo Rey San Jose High School in East
San Jose.  Cristo Rey provides an incredible education for low-income students
in the greater San Jose area and allows them to pay for their private
education through a work study program in which  they are placed at businesses
across the Silicon Valley.  The work they complete there helps to educate them
in ways that learning in a classroom never could.  The Cristo Rey network does
an amazing job helping and preparing students across the country for
successful and productive adult lives.

As the first semester at Cristo Rey San Jose begins to wind down, I finally
feel like I know enough about the school and what I will be learning and
helping with for the rest of the school year!  It is so fun working in such a
fast-paced environment and I have loved being thrown right into the mix.  The
Corporate Work Study office is constantly buzzing with activity as students
and faculty pop in and out and the Work Study coordinators run around helping
the students and partners every day.  

One of my main tasks throughout this quarter has been to help out with Magis
classes on Friday mornings, which has been an awesome surprise!  These classes
are centered around various topics relating to the workplace and provide me
with  time to meet and learn from all of the students.  I greatly look forward
to Friday mornings when I get to come into a new class and help in any way
that I can.

Aside from helping out in the classroom, I have also been working on
administrative tasks such as organizing a job description database within
Salesforce and organizing students’ timecards that they receive each workday
from their supervisors.  This has been fun and challenging because  I have
never worked with Salesforce before. Looking forward to the end of the quarter
and my time in 2018, I want to continue with these main tasks but also learn
more about Cristo Rey’s relationship with their corporate partners.  I am
planning on going to sales pitches that occur when Cristo Rey begins to talk
to potential corporate partners.  I would also like to attend site visits with
existing corporate partners to see students at their workplace.  Overall, I
have learned so much at Cristo Rey already and am looking forward to becoming
a larger part of the community at the school!
