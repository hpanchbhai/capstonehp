## Welcome Back to LSB Study Abroad Students!

Many SCU students are returning from studying overseas. Over 140 LSB students
were abroad for Fall 2018! Several spoke on their experiences.

Garg-1-200x200.png)

Yash Garg  
 _Major:  Finance  
_ _Placement:   London, UK  
_ _Graduation Year:  2020  
_ **What classes did you take?**  I took several different classes: Theology
of Communication, Economics Ecology & the Environment, International
Internship Class, Photojournalism: London through the Lense, British Life and
Cultures.  
 **What was your favorite** **experience?**   ** **  In London my favorite
experience was going to a Chelsea soccer game. My favorite experience from
abroad was skydiving in Switzerland over the Swiss Alps.  
 **What was your favorite place that you visited or a favorite meal that you
ate?******  My favorite place that I visited was Florence, Italy. I had a
chance to climb the Duomo and get a breathtaking view of the entire city of
Florence. I had two favorite meals: Mutton Pepper Fry in London and Squid Ink
Spaghetti in Venice.  
 **What advice would you give to the 2019 Study Abroad students?  **I would
say, that time goes by a lot faster than you think. Take every opportunity to
explore and see the city around you. Each city in Europe has so much to offer
and so many things to do, so definitely make time to explore and get a feel
for the culture and history of the city. That being said, it’s easy to get
exhausted when traveling so much and being in the “go-go-go” attitude so every
now and then it’s important to take a day to recuperate and relax. Finding the
right balance is very important, but definitely prioritize exploring.
Exploring is such a valuable learning opportunity that exposes you to so many
people and ways of life. Make the most of your time, but definitely pace
yourself. Walk as much as possible, it helps you see the world around you and
you might see things you might have missed otherwise.

Maddie Thompson  
 _Major:  Management Information Systems  
_ _Placement: San Sebastian, Spain  
_ _Graduation Year:  2020  
_ **What classes did you take?**  I took a Spanish intensive course for the
first two weeks to brush up on the language. After that, I started my normal
coursework which included Fundamentals of Marketing, Entrepreneurship, Cross-
Cultural Communication, which were all taught in English, and another Spanish
language class.  
 **What was your favorite**   **experience?**  My favorite experience had to
be getting to know so many international students through my school! The nine
Santa Clara students were the only ones from the United States, so most of the
other students were local, from Europe, or Latin America. I learned so much
about other cultures from my peers, especially the very unique Basque culture.
** **  
 **What was your favorite place that you visited or a favorite meal that you
ate?******  My favorite place I visited was Rome. Although notorious for being
touristy, it is rightfully so, due to the vast history everywhere you turn. It
was an amazing learning experience, especially because I could experience it
with a fellow bronco who studied abroad in Italy two years ago and now has
moved there to teach English. And my favorite dish had to be the pasta
carbonara that was hand made right in front of me. If not that, then probably
the culinary bite-size "pinchos" that line the bars of San Sebastian.  
 **What advice would you give to the 2019 Study Abroad students?  **My best
advice would be to make sure to discover the culture right at your fingertips!
As much as it's fun to travel on the weekends, my most valuable experiences
were the ones where I actively participated in the local culture of San
Sebastian.

Lam-2-200x200.PNG)

Tiffany Lam  
 _Major: Accounting and Information Systems  
_ _Placement:  Auckland, New Zealand  
_ _Graduation Year:  2020  
_ **What classes did you take?**   I took Financial Management, Understanding
Organizations, Planets, Stars and Galaxies, and Religions in New Zealand.
These classes fulfilled my Finance 121, Management 160, Natural Science, and
Religion 2 requirements.  
 **What was your favorite**   **experience?**  My favorite experience about
being abroad was being able to engage in a new culture and meeting new people.
** **  
 **What was your favorite place that you visited or a favorite meal that you
ate?******  My favorite place that I visited was the Coromandel Peninsula. My
friends and I went on a weekend trip up to the peninsula where we visited
Cathedral Cove and dug a pool at the Hot Water Beach.  
 **What advice would you give to the 2019 Study Abroad students?  **Don't be
discouraged to try new things. Being abroad offers many unique experiences,
but you'll never know what they entail until you try them.

Andy Meger  
 _Major:  Economics  
_ _Placement:  Vienna, Austria  
_ _Graduation Year:  2020  
_ **What classes did you take?**   I took an international business class,
music history, Central European history, and German. I also had the
opportunity to intern at an environmental NGO through my program.  
 **What was your favorite**   **experience?**  My favorite experience was
skiing in the Austrian Alps near Innsbruck. ** **  
 **What was your favorite place that you visited or a favorite meal that you
ate?******  My favorite place was probably the mountains of Slovenia. My
favorite meal was Spaghetti Carbonara in Venice.  
 **What advice would you give to the 2019 Study Abroad students?  **Make sure
to spend plenty of time in your home city. While traveling is amazing, getting
to feel like a local in a different country is a special experience.

Correa-200x200.JPG)

Alexa Correa  
 _Major:  Marketing  
_ _Placement:  Sevilla, Spain  
_ _Graduation Year:  2020  
_ **What classes did you take?**  Abroad I took International Marketing, a
class about the biochemical details of the Mediterranean Diet, a Spanish
conversational class, and lastly, a class called Christianity, Islam and
Judaism in the Spanish Context.  
 **What was your favorite**   **experience?**  I would have to say my favorite
experience was going to my Spanish friend’s house for my birthday. Some
friends from my program came with me to his house near the end of the
semester, his mom cooked paella, we sang karaoke and then they surprised me
with a cake (chocolate fudge, my favorite). It was definitely a day I won’t
forget!  ** **  
 **What was your favorite place that you visited or a favorite meal that you
ate?******  My favorite place that I visited was without a doubt Morocco. We
traveled by boat and bus to Rabat and many other cities including the “blue
city” Chefchaouen. The best part was getting to talk to Moroccan students and
learning about their culture, their favorite places and their favorite music.
My favorite meal was also in Morocco, which was couscous with chicken,
vegetables, and a sweet sauce drizzled on top followed by cookies and mint
tea.  
 **What advice would you give to the 2019 Study Abroad students?  **Don’t
spend too much time worrying about what’s going on at home; things might
happen while you are gone that might give you the “fear of missing out” but
don’t forget you will be having the time of your life abroad! Also, if your
program/school gives you the option to get paired with a student from the
country you are studying in (in Spain it was called the Intercambio program)
definitely try to do it, it’s a great way to meet locals and improve your
language skills.

Ailene Nguyen  
 _Major:  Accounting and Information Systems  
_ _Placement:  Seoul, South Korea  
_ _Graduation Year:  2020  
_ **What classes did you take?**  I took two business classes and three
cultural electives, one of which was the Korean language.  
 **What was your favorite**   **experience?**  My favorite experience in Seoul
was walking around Seoullo 7017, an overpass remodeled into a pedestrian-
friendly park. Dubbed a sky garden, Seoullo 7017 is full of greenery, but
lights up at night, making it the perfect place for an evening stroll. There
are also many eateries and dessert cafes along the pathway for people to stop
by and enjoy the views of the city. ** **  
 **What was your favorite place that you visited or a favorite meal that you
ate?******  My favorite meal in Korea was soondubu (soft tofu stew), often
served with rice and banchan (side dishes). I had soondubu for one of my first
meals in Korea, since it was the most familiar to me, and it ended up being my
go-to meal at multiple restaurants open 24/7 near the university.  
 **What advice would you give to the 2019 Study Abroad students?  **Some
advice I have for 2019 study abroad students is to do a lot of research on the
program or university you are applying to. Look for potential scholarships to
help fund your studies abroad. I received a few scholarships and they really
helped lessen the financial burden, allowing me to enjoy my time abroad to the
fullest!

Henry Godfrey  
 _Major:  Finance and French  
_ _Placement: Paris, France  
_ _Graduation Year:  2020  
_ **What classes did you take?**  My five classes included: French Language in
Context, Business French, International and Intercultural Management,
International Political Economy, Entrepreneurship.  
 **What was your favorite**   **experience?**  My favorite experience this
fall was attending a Paris Saint-Germain football (soccer game). Watching the
incredible European soccer players in person whom I had followed for years in
advance was an amazing experience. In addition I went with my the son of my
host family, spoke french throughout the game and had the opportunity to
experience the culture of french football.  
**What was your favorite place that you visited or a favorite meal that you
ate?  **My favorite place I visited was Barcelona because it was my first trip
meeting with other Santa Clara students, also it was over Halloween!  
 **What advice would you give to the 2019 Study Abroad students?  **My advice
to 2019 Study Abroad students is to ask themselves in advance how immersed
they want to be in their host country's culture. Do you want to people from
the US on your program? From SCU? From the host country? In addition research
the program you are studying on and take advantage of all opportunities. My
class at the Paris School of Business was one of my most valuable experiences
this fall even though it was more work.
