The 2019 application for both the Weekend and Summer Program is now open.
[Apply now!](https://slate.scu.edu/apply/?sr=c7706d42-f5e1-40a7-86cf-
cc9c002a9e89)

The CAAP Program consists of eight undergraduate level accounting courses to
be completed in either our summer or weekend program. All courses are held on
campus at Santa Clara University.

Please feel free to contact our office directly at caap@scu.edu or by phone at
(408) 554-4522 should you have any questions.

##### Summer Cohorts

__

The Summer 2019 calendar is now available. [Click
here](/business/caap/current/schedules/ "Home » Home » Leavey School of
Business » Certificate of Advanced Accounting Proficiency » Current Students »
Schedules") to be taken to the schedule.

The Summer Program consists of eight undergraduate courses that are completed
in approximately 14 weeks. Of the eight courses, seven are required to receive
the certificate (ACTG 181-187). ACTG 180 is strongly recommended for students
who have not taken university-level accounting courses in the past year, and
is required for students who have not previously taken any accounting courses.
If you would like to petition to waive ACTG 180 please contact the CAAP
Admissions Team directly at CAAP@scu.edu or (408) 554-4522.

Students attend class for four hours on Monday-Friday, in either an AM or PM
session. The AM session begins at 9AM and runs until 1PM. The PM session
begins at 2:30PM and runs until 6:30PM. If enrollment does not warrant two
sessions, there will only be an AM session.

Students are encouraged to limit non-academic activities (e.g. work) while
enrolled in the Summer CAAP program, and should anticipate six to eight hours
of daily out-of-class study.

In order to successfully complete the program, students must receive a minimum
overall GPA of 2.0 as well as a passing grade in each individual class. A
course grade of less than C- requires a meeting with the CAAP Faculty Director
to obtain permission to continue in the program. Two grades of less than C-
will result in automatic dismissal from the program. Those who successfully
complete the program will earn a Certificate of Advanced Accounting
Proficiency from Santa Clara University.

Priority consideration will be given to students who enroll in the entire
certificate program (ACTG 181-187). Individuals who can demonstrate the need
for specific accounting classes will be accommodated on a space available
basis. Such students should contact the CAAP Program Director at (408)
554-4522 or by email at [CAAP@scu.edu](mailto:CAAP@scu.edu).

##### Weekend Cohorts

__

The 2018 - 2019 Weekend Program calendar is available
[here](/business/caap/current/schedules/ "Home » Home » Leavey School of
Business » Certificate of Advanced Accounting Proficiency » Current Students »
Schedules"). The 2019 - 2020 schedule will be posted soon.  
  
The Weekend Program consists of eight undergraduate courses that are completed
in approximately nine months. Of the eight courses, seven are required to
receive the certificate (ACTG 181-187). ACTG 180 is strongly recommended for
students who have not taken university-level accounting courses in the past
year, and is required for students who have not previously taken any
accounting courses. If you would like to petition to waive ACTG 180 please
contact the CAAP Admissions Team directly at CAAP@scu.edu or (408) 554-4522.



Students in the weekend program take the courses from September through June
on either Saturdays (cohort 1) or Sunday (cohort 2). Students meet in class on
either Saturday or Sunday (not both) for eight hours each day: from 9AM - 6PM
with a one-hour break. Each course lasts about five weeks.

In order to successfully complete the program, students must receive a minimum
overall GPA of 2.0 as well as a passing grade in each individual class. A
course grade of less than C- requires a meeting with the CAAP Faculty Director
to obtain permission to continue in the program. Two grades of less than C-
will result in automatic dismissal from the program. Those who successfully
complete the program will earn a Certificate of Advanced Accounting
Proficiency from Santa Clara University.  
  
Individuals who can demonstrate the need for specific accounting classes will
be accommodated on a space available basis. Such students should contact the
CAAP Program Director at (408) 554-4522 or by email at
[CAAP@scu.edu](mailto:CAAP@scu.edu). Priority consideration will be given to
students who enroll in the entire certificate program (ACTG 181-187).
