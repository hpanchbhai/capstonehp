Keyra Galvan

#### Fulbright Research Scholarship Recipient

A professor’s passion for economics attracted Keyra Galvan to business where
she focused her energies while at SCU. Combining a dedication to community
with the advice to “never lose hope and always keep your eyes on the prize,”
Keyra, a recent alumna from San Jose who majored in economics and minored
international business, has taken her talents south to Mexico. Made possible
by a Fulbright Research Scholarship, she has packed her things and will spend
the next year applying her business skills abroad. We spoke to Keyra about the
scholarship and her plans for the future.

**Tell us about the Fulbright Research grant: how did you learn about it, how
did you apply, when and how did you learn that you had received it?**

I first learned about Fulbright through an alumna of the professional business
fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi. I asked to meet up with her for coffee and that is
when she began to explain to me her post-grad plans in the Netherlands through
the Fulbright Program. She was the one to encourage me to talk to the
Fulbright advisor here at SCU and apply via the online portal. I received an
official letter in the mail as well as an email regarding my acceptance into
the Fulbright Program.

**What will you be doing with the grant?**

I will be traveling to Mexico City, Mexico for the 2015-16 academic year to
combine business coursework at a local university with an internship at a
Mexico-based company.

**How have your SCU / Business School experiences contributed to your future
plans?**

As an economics major and international business minor, I hope to work in
business in an international setting. My ideal job would combine business
development with international awareness of how foreign companies engage in
international negotiations. My long term goal is to go back to grad school and
work with a company that values social entrepreneurship.

**What kind of person would gain the most from a Santa Clara education like
the one you've pursued?**

This person would have to be highly motivated and willing to take risks. For
me, the times I was most challenged at Santa Clara were the times I felt the
biggest sense of accomplishment. One would gain the most from an SCU education
if they are willing to step outside their comfort zone and try new things.
