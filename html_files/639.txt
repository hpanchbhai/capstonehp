Dr. Andy Tsay is Professor of Business and Analytics, in the department of
Information Systems & Analytics (ISA) in the Leavey School of Business at
Santa Clara University, where he teaches primarily in the MBA and Executive
MBA programs for working professionals.  He served as Department Chair from
2010-2017.

He earned his Ph.D. at Stanford University's [Graduate School of
Business](http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/). He also holds degrees from Stanford
in Engineering (MS) and Mathematical & Computational Sciences (BS).

Dr. Tsay has expertise in business analytics and quantitative modeling. He
studies the management of design, manufacturing, and procurement in heavily
outsourced supply chains (e.g., electronics, apparel, food). His work helps
manufacturers better engage with suppliers and distribution channel partners.

He has more than 35 professional publications in leading academic journals
such as _[Management Science](http://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/mnsc),
[Manufacturing & Service Operations
Management](http://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/msom), [Production &
Operations Management](http://www.poms.org/journal/),
[Interfaces](http://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/inte), [Journal of
Retailing](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-retailing/ "Journal of
Retailing")_ , and _[Journal of Supply Chain
Management](https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/pubs/journalscm/index.cfm?navItemNumber=5474)_
, and practitioner periodicals such as _[Supply Chain Management
Review](http://www.scmr.com/) _ and _ [International Commerce
Review](https://www.whu.edu/en/faculty-research/centers/center-for-
collaborative-commerce/international-commerce-review-ecr-journal/)_. He serves
in senior leadership positions for several of these journals (see bottom of
this page). In 2014 his book   _[Designing and Controlling the Outsourced
Supply Chain](http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/0200000030)_ was published by [NOW
Publishers](http://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/TOM-030). Download a
free PDF of this book and Dr. Tsay's other publications
[here](https://www.scu.edu/business/omis/faculty/tsay/research/ "Tsay
research").

His publications have been cited more than 5500 times (according to [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zHjE-J0AAAAJ&hl=en)). His
2008 paper in _Journal of Supply Chain Management_ (with Roth, Pullman, and
Gray) received a 2012 _[Emerald Management Reviews Citation of
Excellence](http://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/authors/literati/citations/awards.htm?id=2012)_
, awarded to only 50 articles worldwide across all business specialties.

He has consulted for large firms as well as startups in Silicon Valley and
China. He has been interviewed extensively in the [global
media](https://www.scu.edu/business/isa/faculty/tsay/media/), by outlets such
as _The New York Times_ , ABC News, Voice of America, CCTV, and _China Daily._
He has lectured to academic and industry audiences throughout North America,
Europe, and Asia.

He serves frequently as a visiting professor at [Peking
University](http://www.pku.edu.cn/), teaching in the [Beijing International
MBA](http://en.bimba.pku.edu.cn/) program, which has honored him with its
_Teaching Excellence Award_.

In 2007 the [Production & Operations Management Society](http://www.poms.org/)
(POMS) recognized Dr. Tsay with the _[Wickham Skinner Award for Teaching
Innovation](http://www.poms.org/skinner_awards/)_. POMS is the premier
international professional society for the study and practice of Operations
Management, with more than 2,000 members in 60 countries. One such award is
given each year.

He is an eight-time recipient of the Leavey School of Business _Dean's Award
for Extraordinary Performance in Research, Teaching, and Service_. He has won
dozens of other school-level awards.

Dr. Tsay currently serves as an "Open Classroom" professor, one of nine (and
the only business professor) invited by the Provost’s Office to serve as
teaching mentors for the university's entire body of instructors.
