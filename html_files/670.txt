Helpful information for International Applicants

You may have questions about graduate business study in the U.S. and this
section will help you. If you need additional information, we welcome a call
(408-554-4539) or email ([msadmissions@scu.edu](mailto:msadmissions@scu.edu)).

**In addition to submitting[general application materials](/business/ms-
business-analytics/prospective-students-faq/application-checklist/ "Home »
Home » Leavey School of Business » MS Business Analytics » Prospective
Students » Application Checklist"), international students should be aware of
the requirements below.**

###### TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)

Applicants whose first language is not English (regardless of whether your
schooling was in English) must take the **TOEFL** (Test of English as a
Foreign Language) and have ETS send the scores directly to Santa Clara
University, Institution Code 4851. A minimum TOEFL score of 100 on the IBT
test. We also accept the IELTS. A minimum score of 7.0 is required.  The TOEFL
may be waived if the applicant receives a score in the 50th percentile or
higher on the verbal portion of the GMAT/GRE or have obtained a U.S. degree
from an accredited institution. You should confirm your eligibility for a
waiver with the Graduate Business Admissions office.

###### Visas

You can start the process of applying for a visa once you are admitted to
Santa Clara University, confirmed your intention to enroll, and have submitted
your enrollment deposit. Please read more about [International
Students](https://www.scu.edu/globalengagement/international-students/) at SCU
and learn how to request [immigration
documents](https://www.scu.edu/globalengagement/international-students/apply-
and-getting-started/immigration-process/) and start the [visa process.
](https://www.scu.edu/globalengagement/international-students/immigration-
status-travel-and-visas/travel--visas/applying-for-your-visa/)

NOTE:  ** _International students who are studying on the F-1 visa are not
eligible for the Executive MBA programs._**

###### Financial Aid

Federal financial aid is not available for non-US citizens, except in cases
where they have attained Permanent Resident status and have made application
for citizenship. International students are eligible for scholarships. For
more information, please contact the Graduate Business Admissions and
Financial Aid, Leavey School of Business, 408-554-4539.

###### U.S. Employment for Foreign Students

To learn more about employment opportunities for international students on- or
off-campus, please visit the [International Students and
Scholars](/global/international-students/ "Home » Home » Global »
International Students") »

######  

##### How do I get my degree evaluated?

__

If you have a degree from a foreign institution, you are required to submit
the WES course-by-course evaluation. Due to an increased incidence of
fraudulent documents, we have decided to only accept documents from
[WES.org](https://www.wes.org/) and no other NACES organization. Because of
this increase in fraud, degrees from India and China may endure a longer
processing time with WES. Plan early. Processing may take up to 12 weeks for
an evaluation.

##### As an applicant who would need an F1 Student Visa to study in the U.S.,
which programs are full-time?

__

International applicants, those needing a student visa to study in the
program, are eligible to apply for all MS programs.

##### Is it possible to receive conditional admission before taking the GMAT
or GRE?

__

No. All required application materials must be received by the Admissions
Office in order for an admissions decision to be made. The GMAT or GRE is
required for all applicants.

##### I have little work experience. Am I eligible for any of Santa Clara's MS
programs?

__

Exceptionally qualified international students with fewer than three years of
professional work experience are eligible to apply to our MS in Business
Analytics program. Please consult with the Graduate Business Admissions office
staff who can review your application with you and determine the best fit for
you.

##### I have a three-year degree; am I eligible to apply?

__

Have your degree evaluated by [World Education
Services](https://www.wes.org/).  WES is a non-profit their dedicated to
helping international students and professionals achieve educational and
professionals goals in the United States and Canada. WES is approved by the
National Association Credential Evaluation Services, also known as NACES.
NACES is an association of private foreign educational credential evaluation
services committed to formulating and maintaining ethical standards in the
field of foreign educational evaluation. If your WES evaluation confirms that
your degree is equivalent to a four-year U.S. bachelor's degree, you are
eligible to apply.

##### Do I need to take the TOEFL?

__

The TOEFL may be waived only if the applicant receives a score in the 50th
percentile or higher on the verbal portion of the GMAT or GRE. Applicants
whose GMAT/GRE score was lower than the 50th percentile, and whose native
language is not English (regardless of whether your schooling was in English)
must take the [TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign
Language)](http://www.toefl.org) and have ETS send the scores directly to
**Santa Clara University, Institution Code 4851**. A minimum TOEFL of 100 on
the IBT test  is required. Applications with a degree from an accredited U.S.
university are waived from the TOEFL requirement.

##### Is the MS in Business Analytics STEM-certified?

__

Yes! This means you may be eligible to remain in the United States for an
additional period on an Optional Practical Training (OPT) STEM extension after
you earn the degree. For details, please see the Santa Clara University
[Global Engagement website about OPT STEM extension
regulations](/globalengagement/international-students/working--academic-
internships/stem-opt-extension/ "Home » Home » Global Engagement »
International Students » Working & Academic Internships » STEM OPT
Extension").
