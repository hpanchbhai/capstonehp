## Tammy Madsen : Tesla Model 3 : ABC7 News

Professor Tammy Madsen discusses the production issues that Tesla has had with
its Model 3.

![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/management/Madsen-3782web-1-140x180.jpg)

Professor of Management Tammy Madsen was quoted in an article about Tesla’s
recent losses. According to _[ABC7 News](http://abc7news.com/automotive/tesla-
posts-big-loss-and-announces-delay-in-production/2597691/)_ , Tesla has had
slower production than anticipated for its promised Model 3 cars. CEO Elon
Musk had promised 15 hundred of this model, but only 220 have actually been
made leading to losses in their earnings report. Madsen suggests that Tesla is
still not familiar with the high volume industry of car making citing their
success at producing small volume.

An excerpt from the article:

_"They've been successful at producing at small volume but we haven't seen
demonstrated success at building at large volume. They don't have that
expertise yet," said Madsen._
