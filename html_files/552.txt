# Concentrations

  2. [Leavey School of Business](/business/)
  3. [Current Students](/business/graduates/)
  4. [Academics](/business/graduates/academic/)
  5. Concentrations 

Concentrations provide you with intensive study either within a discipline or
in a unified theme across disciplines.

In consultation with Silicon Valley employers, Santa Clara University business
faculty has developed several concentrations to enhance your understanding of
current topics, preparing you for careers in demand throughout our dynamic
economy.

These concentrations build on foundational business knowledge by offering
advanced coursework and integrating current business topics. As a result,
you'll develop expertise and connections in particular functions or
industries. Evening MBA students may choose to complete one concentration unit
comprising a minimum of 12 units within a specific subject area as part of the
degree.

##### Data Science and Business Analytics

__

This concentration is inter-disciplinary. It meets a growing need for
knowledge workers in the Valley who employ quantitative methods, economic
paradigms, and technology to business processes and decision making. The
student who specializes in this concentration will have strong analytical and
data skills combined with business knowledge that will be applied to solving
problems where business intelligence is a fundamental driver of corporate
value.

_**Learning Objectives**_

  * Understand and acquire technical expertise in various quantitative fields such as statistics, econometrics, stochastic processes, calculus, optimization, and software paradigms, that underlie various analyses undertaken by corporations.
  * Learn how to build models (theoretical and econometric) to characterize business situations, develop strategies, and analyze these models collecting, verifying, and using data to achieve optimal business decisions.

business-analytics/)

##### Entrepreneurship and New Venture Creation

__

Leveraging SCU's location and strong alumni presence in Silicon Valley, this
concentration examines the tools needed to develop ideas into businesses and
to stimulate entrepreneurial activities in existing mature businesses.

_**Learning Objectives**_

  * To develop an analytical framework for evaluating new business opportunities.
  * To review some of the special operating problems of new enterprises including the problems of survival in the early years, maintaining growth in an orderly fashion, and maintaining momentum as the firm approaches maturity. This involves developing and integrating an understanding of the accounting, finance, marketing, operations and management issues that start-ups face.
  * To identify the unique entrepreneurial challenges faced by start-ups in high-technology sectors of the economy – these include infotech, biotech and cleantech. This involves reviewing the salient characteristics of these sectors, identifying the key strategic issues associated with them and then providing tools/frameworks to address these challenges.
  * To provide an opportunity for students to evaluate their own abilities and goals in regard to small business opportunities. A career in one's own business has both advantages and disadvantages.
