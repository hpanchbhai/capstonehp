The Accounting Department shares with the University its fundamental mission
to make student learning its central focus. Our goal is to develop superior
students who will be sought for their skills, integrity, and professional
attitude. We fulfill this mission through our involvement in several academic
programs in which we strive to impart the accounting knowledge and ethical
values that students in these programs need to understand and use accounting
information in their professional business careers. We facilitate our
students’ transition from the academic community to the professional community
by promoting accounting scholarships, internships, and events that encourage
student interaction with practicing accountants.

The Accounting Department promotes its overall mission by engaging in
empirically- driven discipline-based scholarship, practice-driven advances,
and pedagogical research on important accounting issues that is disseminated
to our students, accounting scholars, and the business community through
classroom settings, workshop presentations, and peer-reviewed articles. Our
goal is to continuously improve the classroom experience and lead accounting
thought through a mix of original research and thought-provoking commentary on
accounting-related topics.
