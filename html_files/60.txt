# Real Estate Has Long Been an Intriguing Investment Vehicle

While memories of the Great Recession may still loom large in potential
investors’ minds, money continues to flow into commercial and residential real
estate. That trend is expected to continue, and one can look back at
investment winners of 2016 to predict who will secure the most attention (and
investment dollars) in 2017.

If last year is any indication, the safe bet is on real estate technology
solutions and services providers.

But today, land and buildings are not the only investments that present
significant moneymaking opportunities. Technology companies that facilitate
investing, buying and selling processes are also attracting millions in
venture capital.

There’s a lot of opportunity with both residential and commercial properties
to use today’s technology in real estate and help grow the country’s largest
asset worth an estimated $40 trillion.
