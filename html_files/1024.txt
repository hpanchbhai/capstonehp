Alan Nguyen

#### Senior Associate, Risk & Compliance Systems & Analytics

Alan Nguyen probably has one of the most exciting jobs in finance and
accounting. He helps provide data analytics to public companies and helps
later-stage start-ups go public as part of his duties as a senior associate in
the Risk & Compliance Systems & Analytics group at PricewaterhouseCoopers
(PwC), the largest professional services firm in the world and one of the “Big
Four” accounting firms.

“There is always something new and exciting,” said Nguyen, who joined PwC
right after graduating from Santa Clara in 2013 with a degree in Accounting
and Information Systems (AIS), a relatively new major offered since 2008 at
the Leavey School of Business.

“AIS majors get gobbled up in a heartbeat in the job market,” says Michael
Eames, associate professor in the SCU Department of Accounting. “Basically,
it’s a double major — neither one of which is particularly easy — which tends
to attract a particular kind of student.”

Nguyen’s reason for earning an AIS major had to do with his long-term goals.

“It’s just not enough to understand business or accounting,” he said. “The AIS
major gives you the additional tools and techniques to do more. You’re not
just focused on the IT or the accounting side, but leveraging the technical
skill sets and business acumen from both.”

He added that his favorite class, Prof. Manoochehr Ghiassi’s Operations and
Management Information Systems 137 (Object Oriented Programming), “instilled a
sense of urgency and performance” that he found invaluable. “You learn not
just how to program, but how to think.”

“Employers understand the multidisciplinary benefits of having an AIS major,”
Nguyen said.

He added that his SCU education also gave him advantages that go far beyond
his professional life. A Bay Area native, he found that SCU offered the
smaller classes and more intimate campus he wanted along with a quality
business education and proximity to tech companies. He worked in the Leavey
School of Business Dean’s Office, was an accounting teaching assistant, member
of the Men’s Varsity rowing team, belonged to the Accelerated Cooperative
Education (ACE) business school honors program, and served on the Associated
Student Government Supreme Court.

“SCU educates the whole person,” he said. “There’s a sense of community and
integrity as well as a comprehensive business education.”

That community also extends beyond the campus proper.

“I’m always talking to my friends from SCU across multiple generations of
Broncos,” he said. “There are a lot of alums here at PwC. The ACE group was a
cohort of similar-minded people who were academically driven. Some are still
my best friends today. Once a Bronco, always a Bronco!”
