# Assurance of Learning

  3. [About LSB](/business/about/)

  5. Assurance of Learning 

#### Assurance of Learning

The Leavey School of Business assesses student learning through a continual
process of articulating learning goals and regularly evaluating how well our
students meet those goals in each of the School's programs. Each program
evaluates its goals and learning objectives using its own instruments and
rubrics. The evaluations are shared with the Undergraduate Leadership Team or
the Graduate Policy Committee, and with the University’s Office of Assessment.
Recommendations are then developed and implemented collaboratively.

#### A Roadmap for Each Program

The assurance of learning process begins with a shared vision for each LSB
program. Each program captures its vision with a road map to tie its goals to
the curriculum; and it develops its own assessment tools and approach to
evaluation

Take a look at the LSB roadmaps
