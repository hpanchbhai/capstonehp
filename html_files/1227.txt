### Jordan Agnew Named  
2014 Outstanding  
Student Entrepreneur

Congratulations to 2014 Outstanding Student Entrepreneur Jordan Agnew!   This
honor is awarded annually by the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship to
a graduating student enrolled in the Undergraduate Entrepreneurship Program in
recognition of significant achievements in the program, acknowledgment of
accomplishments in entrepreneurship and the promise of future success.

## Jordan Agnew

* * *

He co-founded Mumble with fellow SCU student Aaron Ebert, with the goal to
help connect people with shared interests and provide a platform for polling
trending topics.

When Jordan arrived at Santa Clara University as a freshman from Southern
California, he hit the ground running with a number of ideas with the same
theme--ways to make things better.  It's perhaps this thinking that makes him
such a prime candidate for this award.

He was the youngest member of Santa Clara University's California Program for
Entrepreneurship, having just completed his freshman year when he was accepted
in the 2011 Cohort.   Jordan worked through several ventures throughout the
program and certainly held his own with the graduate school-level content and
was an active, engaged participant with an unmatched enthusiasm.

He co-founded Mumble with fellow SCU student Aaron Ebert, with the goal to
help connect people with shared interests and provide a platform for polling
trending topics.   In just 15 days, they had more than 150 mumblers polling
1,000 mumbles.   Jordan has shared the Mumble story at a number ofCenter for
Innovation and Entrepreneurship presentations including a number of CIE
Advisory Board meetings and before a standing-room-only crowd at SCU Family
Weekend.

business/cie/jordan-3-360x239.jpg)

Earlier this year, he brought his startup experience to the Leavey School of
Business Neighborhood Prosperity Initiative, working with San Jose small
businesses.  His team worked with Romero's Cakes, owned and operated by the
Romero family for more than 20 years in Downtown San Jose.  Jordan immediately
started putting together ideas of how he could help them.  In his own words,
"A project like this is why I minored in Entrepreneurship; I love the idea of
being part of a small business and trying to come up with simple ideas to
improve it.   I have spent countless hours reviewing case studies, defining
markets, analyzing financials and other "business school 101" activities, but
this experience feels like the one for which I have been building my skills."

Jordan is graduating with a major in Finance and a minor in Entrepreneurship.
He is indeed a shining example of what entrepreneurship at Santa Clara can do
for our communities.

He will receive this award at the Leavey School of Business Senior Awards
Ceremony on June 13 with a presentation by Dr. Kumar Sarangee, Assistant
Professor of Marketing.
