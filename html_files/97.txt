business/undergraduates/global-fellows/GF-Home-Page-360x360.jpg)

**Service, Academics, and Leadership**

The Global Fellows program is SCU’s premier professional internship
opportunity. Every year, the program recruits exceptional students to travel
all over the world and participate in a 6 to 8 week internship with an NGO or
business. It provides students with leadership development and an
understanding of the increasing level of globalization in our world.

The goal of the Global Fellows Program is to foster global citizens of
competence, conscience, and compassion through an emphasis on service,
academics, and leadership.



**Who we are?**

Started in 2008 through the Leavey School of Business, Global Fellows is a
9-month leadership program culminating in a summer international internship.
The Program has sent over 250 students to intern in Bolivia, India, China,
Indonesia, The Gambia, Morocco, Ghana, Guatemala, Tanzania, Armenia, El
Salvador, Ethiopia, Hong Kong, Nicaragua, Zanzibar, and Turkey.

**What does the fellowship offer?**

Fellows participate in a spring quarter leadership practicum that engages
their knowledge of global citizenship and what it means to be a leader in the
21st century. The class also includes extensive research of the Fellows’
placement countries and provides context for the international work experience
of their internship. Following spring quarter, Fellows head abroad for a 6 to
8 week internship with an NGO or business that embodies the ideals of global
leadership and reflects the increasing level of globalization in our world.



**What Makes A Fellow?**

Fellows are the change-makers, the go-getters, the leaders of their
communities. The Global Fellows Program recruits exceptional students who are
engaged, contemplative, independent, compassionate, innovative, and curious.
