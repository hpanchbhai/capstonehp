**About LSB Peer Advising**  

![Peer Advising Logo](/media/leavey-school-of-business/undergraduates/peer-
advising-pictures-/Peer-Advisor-Main-Logo-280x355.png)

A team of business students, trained and knowledgeable about LSB requirements,
can show you how to use Santa Clara's many advising resources and materials,
especially in your first year. You can contact LSB-PeerAdvisor@scu.edu to ask
a question or schedule an appointment.

_**As a first-year student**_ , you'll be paired-up with an experienced LSB
Peer Advisor in addition to your assigned Faculty Advisor. You'll be contacted
by your assigned Peer Advisor in August, prior to your arrival on campus, and
be scheduled for an initial meeting with your LSB Peer Advisor early in your
first Fall quarter.
