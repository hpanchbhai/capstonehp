## ACE Senior Profiles: Catherine Kang and Francis Tan

Looking back, seniors have been through four years of ups and downs… but the
best is yet to come. Looking forward into the future, let’s take a glimpse at
where two of our ACE seniors, Cathering Kang and Francis Tan, will be in the
coming years.

For many Santa Clara University seniors, spring quarter is a bittersweet time.
Looking back, seniors have been through four years of ups and downs… but the
best is yet to come.  Looking forward into the future, let’s take a glimpse at
where two of our ACE seniors, Cathering Kang and Francis Tan, will be in the
coming years.

Headshot-1-360x538.jpg)

Catherine Kang, a finance major, will be starting at Intel as a Financial
Analyst where she will be “conducting business analysis strategy and
[providing] financial consulting… to drive profit growth.”  As she looks
forward to starting at Intel, Catherine is excited to work on impactful
projects with her future team and be a part of Intel’s innovative and flexible
work culture.

Looking back, Catherine explains that the career preparation she completed
through ACE truly helped her through the job search process.  She reveals that
“ACE helped [her] develop the interview skills to prep well for the process
and enabled [her] to reach out to alumni on LinkedIn.”  She also utilized
well-practiced networking skills to draw Intel’s interest when they came to
recruit at SCU for the first time.

Before she jumps into her new career, Catherine plans on traveling to Europe
to visit Greece, the South of France, Berlin, and London in addition to
continuing her volunteer and foster work with the Humane Society.

Francis Tan, who is also a finance major, will be joining NetApp’s Central
Program Management Office team as a Program Manager.  As a Program Manager,
Francis will be responsible for managing and implementing IT oriented systems.
Specifically, he will “drive initiatives that enhance process documentation,
improve overall performance, and build and create solutions to supplement
process improvement projects.”  At NetApp, Francis is excited to work with
cross-functional teams and take on a number of diverse and challenging
projects.  

Francis was first connected with NetApp at an on-campus career fair.  After
doing research about the company, Francis utilized many of the networking
skills he had learned through ACE to reach out to a number of people who
provided him a better opportunity to secure a full-time position at NetApp.
In addition, Francis’s experiences in ACE “provided [him] with the framework
and confidence to talk to professionals and confidently pitch [his] skills and
experience.”

Following graduation, Francis had originally planned a backpacking trip to
explore Asia.  However, with his start-date posted at two weeks after
graduation, he has decided to explore Seattle for the first time instead.

Best of luck to Catherine and Francis and all of our graduating seniors!
