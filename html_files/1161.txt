## **Accounting: Gateway to Business Analysis**

The SCU accounting program is an eminent provider of accounting professionals
and leaders in the Silicon Valley. LinkedIn ranks our program as #8 in the
nation, based on the success of our graduates, while U.S. News and World
Report ranks our program as #19, based on a national survey of college
officials. We are the sole [AACSB-
accredited](/business/accounting/about/aacsb-accreditation/ "Home » Home »
Leavey School of Business » Accounting » About Us » AACSB Accreditation")
accounting program in Northern California.

Our undergraduate program offers two majors:
[Accounting](/business/accounting/academics/ "Home » Home » Leavey School of
Business » Accounting » Academic Programs") and [Accounting & Information
Systems (A&IS;)](/business/accounting/academics/ "Home » Home » Leavey School
of Business » Accounting » Academic Programs"). Students in both majors are
eligible for merit-based accounting
[scholarships](/business/accounting/beyond-the-classroom/scholarships/ "Home »
Home » Leavey School of Business » Accounting » Beyond the Classroom »
Scholarships") in their sophomore and junior years. Our renowned [Certificate
of Advanced Accounting Proficiency (CAAP)](/business/caap/ "Home » Home »
Leavey School of Business » Accounting » Academic Programs » Certificate
Program") program offers an opportunity for college graduates pursuing CPA
certification to obtain the accounting units required for CPA licensure.

Our students are highly sought after by national and regional accounting
firms. Most of our students participate in [internships and
externships](/business/accounting/beyond-the-classroom/internships/ "Home »
Home » Leavey School of Business » Accounting » Beyond the Classroom »
Internships & Externships"), and then accept full-time job offers before the
beginning of their senior years.
