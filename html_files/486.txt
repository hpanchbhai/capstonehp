Shot-2017-06-29-at-9.18.55-AM-360x321.png)

In addition to his Board Role at Under Armour since 2003, Chip also served
full time at Under Armour between 2011 and 2014 as

Chief Performance Officer with responsibility for developing the company-wide
business strategy, human resources and organizational alignment and processes.
Chip’s background also includes Bain & Co, Princeton University and Stanford
Business School.

**What is the Center for Conscientious Leadership?**  
The Center for Conscientious Leadership is an organization founded by Chip
Adams in 2015. With active participation from many distinguished business,
military, clergy, academic and other leaders, the mission of the Center is to
inspire the next generation to commit to a lifelong journey of individual
discernment, inspired action and more powerful leadership of themselves and
others.

**What is Conscientious Leadership:**  
It is based on the principle that to lead others well, we must first learn to
lead ourselves. Conscientious Leadership is the application of personal
virtue, purpose and accountability to leadership of ourselves and more
inspired and impactful leadership of others. And leading ourselves is a deeply
personal and lifelong journey of discernment…of virtues, priorities and
purpose…and also of ambition and bold action…always for better things.

**Why Santa Clara University**  
“I can think of no better place than SCU to Inspire and Teach Conscientious
Leadership and Capitalism.

  * **Exceptional Students** : Having worked with thousands of young people from over 100 schools, my experience is that SCU grads rank with the best in three things that matter most: capability, “can do attitude” and character.
  * **Ignatian Tradition:**  The most inspirational leaders start with leading themselves. For over 450 years, Ignation principles have focused on personal discernment, bold action and accountability as cornerstones to life. The Ignatian Tradition not only supports Conscientious Leadership, it defines it.
  * **Leadership at Santa Clara:**  I have deep roots at Santa Clara University and have experienced meaningful relationships with those in leadership positions. I know that President Michael Engh, S.J., Dean Caryn Beck-Dudley, Bill Mains, and many other university leaders are committed to developing people of character and leadership.
  * **Location in Silicon Valley:**  At Santa Clara, we are at the global epicenter of technology and innovation. Changing lives through new ideas is not the exception but a given. And our ability to draw on conscientious leaders of change for inspiration is second to none.
