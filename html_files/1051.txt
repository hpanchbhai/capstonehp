## 2013-0603 [21世纪经济报道, 21st Century Business Herald (China)]:
苹果避税300亿美元的真相：库克背后的爱尔兰女人 (The inside story about Apple's $30 billion of tax
avoidance: Tim Cook's female lieutenant in Ireland)

##### David Dawson

Professor Tsay explains how companies can manipulate the ownership structure
and geographical footprint of their supply chains in order to reduce tax
liability.  This interview was motivated by Apple CEO Tim Cook's May 2013
appearance before Congress to answer questions about Apple's strategies of
this nature.

This interview has been reprinted in dozens of additional Chinese-language
news outlets.

The  _21st Century Business Herald_ (21世纪经济报道) is a Chinese language
international daily newspaper, headquartered in Guangzhou, with bureaus in
Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and other major cities in China. Considered the "
_Wall Street Journal_  of China" by many professionals, its circulation
exceeds 843,000. It is the greater China region partner of  _Forbes_
magazine.
