## Finance: The Language of Business

Do risk management for an emerging company. Or investment banking for an
established one. A degree in finance preps you for both, and more.

Our [faculty members](/business/finance/faculty/ "Home » Home » Leavey School
of Business » Finance » Faculty and Staff") are our backbone. They’ve worked
for banks, consulted for governments around the world, and pushed the
discipline forward with their research. You’ll get a healthy combination of
theory and practice from them.

Finance is one of the most flexible and active aspects of business. So our
[coursework](/business/finance/academics/courses/ "Home » Home » Leavey School
of Business » Finance » Academic Programs » Undergraduate Courses") emphasizes
traditional quantitative methods as well as the psychology and ethics behind
it.

We offer [bachelor's](/business/finance/academics/ "Home » Home » Leavey
School of Business » Finance » Academic Programs") and
[master's](/business/ms-finance/ "Home » Home » Leavey School of Business » MS
Finance") degrees as well as an emphasis program for MBA students. If you want
to apply the skills you learn in an internship, you can take advantage of our
extensive network in and around the Valley.

Finance opens all kinds of doors. Our graduates wind up as analysts with
banks, VC firms, and tech companies. They also go into consulting, management,
and accounting.
