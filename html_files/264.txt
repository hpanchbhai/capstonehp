Professor Hoje Jo started his professional career in 1977, specializing in
Korean plant and steel exports. After several years in the industry, he
decided to pursue a career in academia. Holding a BA in Chinese Literature
from Seoul National University, he went on to receive his MBA in Finance from
State University of New York at Buffalo and his PhD in Finance from the
University of Florida.

Dr. Jo’s main research interests lie in the areas of corporate, international,
venture capital, entrepreneurial finance, and corporate social responsibility.
He published in various leading journals including Journal of Finance, Journal
of Financial Economics, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, Review
of Accounting Studies, and Journal of Business Ethics. Some of Jo’s works have
won him awards from the European Finance Association, Global Finance
Association, and the PACAP Finance Conference. In 1999, the Korean Chamber of
Commerce in Silicon Valley voted him “Professional Man of the Year.”

Recently Dr. Jo received the Moskowitz Prize (2009), the only global award
recognizing outstanding quantitative research in the field of socially
responsible investing.

Professor Jo has been teaching at Santa Clara since 1990 and is heavily
involved with the Santa Clara community, having worked with the Center of
Applied Ethics, the Faculty Senate, the University Research Committee and the
Korean Student Association, among other groups. He was appointed chair of the
Finance Department in July 2011, and served as chair through August 2014.
