institutional ownership related to corporate social responsibility?")

Abstract:

This study examines the relation between corporate social responsibility (CSR)
and institutional investor ownership, and the impact of this relation on stock
return volatility. We find that institutional ownership does not strictly
increase or decrease in CSR; rather, institutional ownership is a concave
function of CSR. This evidence suggests that institutional investors do not
see CSR as strictly value-enhancing activities. Institutional investors adjust
their percentage of ownership when CSR activities go beyond the perceived
optimal level. Employing the path analysis, we also examine the mediating
effect of institutional ownership on the relation between CSR and stock return
volatility. We find that CSR decreases stock return volatility at a decreasing
rate through its effect on institutional ownership. Our results remain robust
under several different CSR measures and estimation methods.
