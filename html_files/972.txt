Reflection and Action

**Post-Graduation Career Search Coaching  
** ACE seniors participate in seminars to help them reflect on their past
internship experiences and plan for their post-college career goals. Students
receive support in further developing professional skills so they are able to
standout in interviews and achieve their desired career goals.

**Transition to Professional Life  
** ACE seniors participate in a retreat to reflect on their program
experiences and plan for the transition from SCU. During this seminar, seniors
are able reconnect with their cohort members and engage with ACE alumni
panelists.

**Senior Recognition  
** Students who complete the program are celebrated at the end of their senior
year at a special ceremony.
