## Big data. Big Business.

Information Systems and Analytics (ISA) is an interdisciplinary department
that considers how technology can facilitate business decisions to guide
organizations to success. [Our curriculum](/business/isa/academics/ "Home »
Home » Leavey School of Business » Operations Management & Information Systems
» Academic Programs") focuses on the intersection of areas like big data and
business intelligence. It combines theory and strategy with hands-on
experience.

As an undergraduate major in Management Information Systems or Accounting &
Information Systems, you’ll have the chance to design applications in the lab
and then put your learning to practice through credit bearing internships. Our
[Master’s in Information Systems](/business/ms-information-systems/ "Home »
Home » Leavey School of Business » MS Information Systems") students all
complete a capstone project, which involves creating and implementing software
for a local company.

We’ve been there—members of [our faculty](/business/ms-information-systems/
"Home » Home » Leavey School of Business » Operations Management & Information
Systems » Faculty and Staff") have founded companies and worked in both
engineering and management. And they are pushing the field forward with
research in business intelligence, software engineering, computer security,
business analytics, and supply chain management.

No other school teaches information systems and analytics like we do. You’ll
be at the forefront of the discipline and have fantastic job prospects when
you graduate.
