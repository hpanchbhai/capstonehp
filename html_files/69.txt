Toby McChesney

#### Senior Assistant Dean of Graduate Business Programs, Leavey School of
Business, Santa Clara University

Toby McChesney has been the senior assistant dean of graduate programs for
Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business since October 2016. He
oversees admissions, student services, and career management for three MBA
programs (Evening, Executive, Online) and four Master of Science programs
(Business Analytics, Finance, Information Systems, Supply Chain Management and
Analytics). Helping to launch a new and improved Evening MBA program, Toby
worked with the team to increase both the quality and quantity of the incoming
fall class resulting in a student increase of 80%. He received the Dean's
Excellence Award for going above and beyond in all aspects of work in the
pursuit of the mission of Leavey School of Business. Previously, Toby was an
assistant dean of graduate programs for Robinson College of Business at
Georgia State University for eight years. In this role, he oversaw three MBA
programs, twenty Master of Science programs, helped lead several re-
organizations, and increased both revenue and enrollments. Prior to GSU, Toby
was at Emory University's Goizueta School of Business in Executive MBA
admissions, and at American University working in undergraduate admissions.
Toby has served on the board of directors of the Graduate Management
Admissions Council and has spoken and presented at numerous GMAC, AACSB, AMBA,
EMBA Council, MBA Roundtable and PTMBA conferences. He is currently on the
Board Chair of the Jesuit Network Group, Board Chair of BusinessCAS and Board
Member of the PTMBA Advisory Board. He earned his bachelor’s degree from
American University, a master’s degree in higher education from George
Washington University, and a doctorate degree in higher education.
