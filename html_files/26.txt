**4+1** is a program designed to provide SCU undergraduates an opportunity to
complete a master’s degree in as little as 10 months. Qualified applicants
will have their GMAT/GRE waived and be eligible for a conditional acceptance
prior to the start of their senior year.

During their senior year, students will enroll in 4-6 graduate level units per
quarter. If students pass their classes with grades of B or better, they will
be eligible to fastrack their Master’s degree the following year, shaving up
to 2 quarters* off the typical full-time program.





**Program Requirements:**

  * A cumulative GPA of 3.3+ at the time of application.
  * Taken relevant coursework that prepares them for a STEM degree **(all MS degrees are STEM-certified)**. This varies based on the Undergraduate major of each student and should be discussed with an admissions officer early in the student's undergraduate years.
  * GRE/GMAT are not required. Note: A valid GRE/GMAT score is needed for scholarship consideration.*  

Students must apply AFTER their Winter grades are posted in their junior year.

Students will take 4-6 units per quarter during their senior year. Students
must pass each class with a grade of B or better. Failing to do so will lead
to the dismissal of the student from the program.

All applicants MUST make an appointment with an MS admissions officer prior to
submitting their application, preferably in the student’s sophomore year. A
formal interview is required after the application is submitted and before a
decision will made.

For further information please contact us at

_*Will depend on the program._
