### Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship accelerates entrepreneurship to
end global poverty and protect the planet.  

[![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/womenx27s-initiative/Miller-center-
logo-360x135.png)](https://www.scu-social-entrepreneurship.org/)  

In March 2018 Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship went on an expedition
to visit social enterprises in Rwanda and Uganda.  We shared a unique
opportunity and witnessed the power of entrepreneurship which transforms lives
and creates climate resilience in poor communities in Rwanda and Uganda.  The
social enterprises visited in the African cities of  Kigali and Kampala have
participated in one of Miller Center's GSBI accelerator programs, and many
have hosted SCU students working on action research projects as part of the
Global Social Benefit Fellowship. ([Miller Center](https://www.scu-social-
entrepreneurship.org/) is an independent center outside of the Leavey School
of Business)
