![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/cie/420-bronco-bikes-360x270.jpg)

Congratulations to 2008-2009 Outstanding Student Entrepreneur Kevin Carter
(second from right).  

This honor is awarded by the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship to the
graduating student enrolled in the Undergraduate Entrepreneurship Program in
recognition of significant achievements in the program, acknowledgment of
accomplishments in entrepreneurship and the promise of future success.  



Kevin is an exemplary model of the entrepreneurial spirit.  Just a few of his
many accomplishments while in the entrepreneurship program include his active
leadership role with the undergraduate student entrepreneurship club, the
SCEO; his founding of Bronco Bikes, a student-run bike share program; and his
pioneering of the CIE’s Mentor Program, making a lasting impression for
students for years to come.



During his time here, Kevin has worked for and interned with Silicon Valley
Bank and Affinity Circles and has recently accepted a position with Baseline
Ventures in San Francisco.



He has been an ambassador for the Center for Innovation and  
Entrepreneurship and a true role model for the students in the program. Kevin
will receive this award at the Leavey School of Business Senior Awards
Ceremony on June 12 with a presentation by CIE Advisory Board Chairman Steve
Foster '84.
