Retail Studies Student Association (RSSA)

Once accepted to the Retail Studies Program, students automatically become
members of the Retail Studies Student Association (RSSA), a student-run
organization with a governing executive board made up of

![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/illustrations-mp/Shopping-
districg-288x177.png)

students and committees responsible for mentoring, mission outreach,
marketing, recruiting, newsletter, corporate liaisons and fundraising. RSSA
provides students with many industry networking, scholarship, social and
leadership opportunities and experiences.

* * *



#### RSSA Experiences

RSSA supports Santa Clara University’s overall mission to teach conscience,
competence, and compassion. The major skills RSSA members acquire are
networking, communication and social skills, professional development, social
responsibility, leadership, and ethical business ideals.

![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/illustrations-mp/Delivery-
Truck-360x158.png)

RSSA hosts a variety of events for Retail Studies students. Events and
gatherings including quarterly dinners with industry innovators as guest
speakers, exposure to industry executive and senior managers who share their
expertise and insight, and opportunities to visit many of the world’s most
influential brands and industry innovators who are leading and redefining the
future of retail.

### Meet the Retail Innovators - Field Trips to SF Bay Area Retailers

The San Francisco Bay Area is home to many of the world’s most influential
brands and industry innovators who are leading and redefining the future of
retail.

logos/Levis-265x130-265x130.png)

Corporate visits to and tours of Retail Management Institute’s alumni
companies and partner organizations provide students with a behind-the scenes
view of leading brand retailers such as Williams-Sonoma, Levi’s, Gap, Inc.,
Lolli&Pops, Stitch Fix, Target and more.

* * *



### Dinner Talk

RMI directors collaborating with the RSSA executive board invites and hosts,
each quarter, a dinner to meet and hear an industry speaker.

including Chairman & CEO of Cost Plus World Market, Google - Account
Executive, Pinterest - Digital Experience Director, Founder - Bed Bandits,

#### Christmas Mission Outreach

Each year, RSSA partners with The Bill Wilson Center
<http://www.billwilsoncenter.org/> for the annual Adopt­a­Family giving
program.

![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/illustrations-mp/Financial-Aid-
Pig-360x200.png)

Each year, RSSA “adopts” a family and gathers together to provide gifts on the
family’s wish list as well as monetary donations. It is a wonderful way for
our students to give back to the surrounding Bay Area community each holiday
season.

#### RSSA President - Class of 2019

## I am honored to be the RSSA President for 2018/19! As Retail Studies
students in Silicon Valley, we all see the retail industry changing before our
eyes; it is exciting because we have the opportunity here at Santa Clara
University to be catalysts of that change.  However, at times such innovation
and advancement can also appear daunting.

## As President, I want to help pave the way for those of us who have
innovative ideas for the industry and for those who want their ideas to be
heard in a welcoming environment. I hope to help further promote this student
excellence and innovation, as we are all the future of retail. Overall, I am
excited for this year and am looking forward to working with all of you!

## Please reach out with any questions about the retail studies program, RSSA
whether you are currently an active member or are interested in joining - I'd
love to talk to you.
