## Faculty Awards

Greg Baker, Jo-Ellen Pozner, Vikram Bhargava, Long Lee, Jennifer Woolley and
Tammy Madsen

Recently, our professors have been awarded a variety of awards. Take a look
below.

  * Greg Baker leading the Food and Agribusiness Institute (FAI) received a number of grants. The Bank of America Charitable Foundation awarded FAI a $15,000 grant for its research on food insecurity and solutions. FAI also received a $60,000 grant in the summer of 2017 for the project “Food Waste Recovery from Supply Chains for Use in Food Donation Programs” from the World Wildlife Fund. The grant is to help fund continuing research in recovering farm-level food waste and channeling it to food assistance programs such as Second Harvest.

  * Jo-Ellen Pozner received a Hackworth grant from the Markkula Center to support her research on how ethical breaches impact individual reputations. This project looks at how inconsistency between an individual’s job function and the characteristics of scandal in which they are involved affects their reputational penalties. 

  * Vikram Bhargava received Hackworth Grant from Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. He will use the grant to support his research project titled “The Role of Off-Duty Laudatory Conduct in Employment Decisions”. The project emails considering the proper business response to the good conduct of employees while not on the job.

  * Long Le received a grant from Faculty Development to create a faculty study group on “Conversations on Lay-Jesuit Partnership: Faculty Stories on Mission and Identity at SCU”. In addition, Ignatian Center awarded Long Le two grants – one is to create a fund after the late Andre Delbecq to provide zero interest loans in east San Jose and abroad, and the other is to develop a Design Thinking pedagogy based Jesuit ethos and identity. 

  * Jennifer Woolley and Tammy Madsen received Extraordinary Faculty Awards for their remarkable contributions to the Leavey School of Business community and the University as a whole.
