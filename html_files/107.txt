## BUSN 70: Contemporary Business Issues

Get a sneak peak at what this introductory business course has to offer
incoming business students.

BUSN 70 is a class designed to help students find their vocations in the world
of business. As an incoming student, you will be given opportunities to learn
directly from seasoned Silicon Valley executives about the nature, structures,
and objectives of how to properly operate a contemporary business and to be
inspired by their tremendous passion towards the subject.

“BUSN 70 really opened my eyes to the endless possibilities of a business
degree from the Leavey School of Business," said Nicole Kim, a Peer Educator
for the course. "You’ll learn the foundations of anything and everything in
business from preparing financial statements to fostering a company culture.
The best part about BUSN 70 is that each professor has extensive, unique
experiences from the business world that they actively incorporate into the
classroom in engaging, hands-on, and discussion-based activities.”

Part of the BUSN 70 curriculum is a business simulation called Mike’s Bikes.
Professor Tim Harris describes the project as "a comprehensive business
simulation that is interesting, complex and challenging. It is a great way to
experience many of the aspects of running a business and making critical
strategic and tactical business decisions (such as price, product, marketing,
capacity, etc), without the potential real life downside. It is a favorite
experience for many of the students.”

Nicole Kim also reflects on her Mike’s Bikes experience saying, “Mike’s Bikes
is all about utilizing your accumulated knowledge from the quarter in lifelike
decision-making for a firm. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes - this simulation
is all about learning through trial and error and having fun with it!”

In the fall of 2019, six professors will be teaching BUSN 70. Find links to
their bios below.
