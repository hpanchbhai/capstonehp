Evening MBA Curriculum

![](/media/leavey-school-of-business/graduates/mba/Evening-MBA-Curriculum.jpg)

Leavey School of Business's MBA program curriculum consists of core courses as
well as electives in various disciplines such as accounting, finance,
marketing, management, economics and operations. The classes are not only
taught by full-time professors but also by practitioners that blend theory
with practice. The core curriculum provides holistic knowledge of different
disciplines that enable students to understand how businesses are managed and
operated. Hence, the students are able to build core management skills and
then move on to specialized electives that reflect their areas of interest.
The classes utilize theory along with practical, case-based lessons and
collaborative learning models to facilitate practical learning. [Most course
descriptions and the curriculum can be seen here
»](https://www.scu.edu/bulletin/graduate/leavey-school-of-business/)

**Schedules**

During each quarter (fall, winter, spring and summer), classes generally meet
twice per week (either Mondays & Wednesdays, or Tuesdays & Thursdays) for ten
weeks for 95 minutes per session (5:45 - 7:20pm and 7:35 - 9:10pm). 2-unit
courses generally meet twice per week for five weeks covering the first or
second half of a quarter. 1-unit courses generally meet once per week for five
weeks covering the first or second half of a quarter. In all quarters, final
exam periods are two hours.

### Curriculum Outline

The Santa Clara MBA curriculum consists of 70 units across 14 core courses (42
units), one required elective (2 units) and 26 additional units of free
electives. While entering students are recommended a particular schedule for
their first year, there is considerable flexibility in the order in which
courses are taken (with the caveat that all prerequisites must be satisfied
before enrolling in a particular course). Math analysis/calculus and basic
statistics proficiency is expected when entering the MBA program.
