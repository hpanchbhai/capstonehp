prerequisites._

OMIS 15 (2 units)

core)

#### Notes

  * You will not complete ALL of the courses listed above in the first year. These are simply suggested courses.
  * By the end of Spring Quarter, first year, you should have completed a minimum of 44-46 units.
  * A score of 4 or 5 in AP statistics yields SCU credit in MATH 8 or OMIS 40. 
    * If you receive AP credit for OMIS 40 you must complete OMIS 15 before you enroll in OMIS 41 or  
ECON 41/42 (ECON majors only).

  * You must declare a major no later than the spring quarter of your sophomore year. Please utilize resources (Faculty Advisor, Career Center, and Department Chairs) to help you begin to make this decision.
  * **The School of Business strictly enforces prerequisites. It is your responsibility to plan your schedule accordingly.**
