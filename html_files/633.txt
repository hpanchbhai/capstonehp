## Nydia MacGregor

#### Lecturer, Management  
Faculty Director, MBA Programs & Alumni Engagement

* * *

Nydia MacGregor joined Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business as
an Assistant Professor of Management after graduating with a Ph.D. from the
Haas School of Business at University of California, Berkeley.

Dr. MacGregor’s research examines how the structure of organizational
populations and the character of available resources influence the founding
and survival of organizations. For example, one portion of her dissertation
evaluates various local attributes that differentially influence the
performance and life cycle of chain and independent establishments. She
studies these issues in several industries, including retailing, bookstores,
and U.S. banking.

Dr. MacGregor has received several awards and fellowships in support of her
research. Among these are the Institute of Management, Innovation and
Organization Doctoral Fellowship; the Center For Responsible Business Ph.D.
Fellowship; and The Crawford Doctoral Scholars Award. She is member of the
American Sociological Association and the Academy of Management, where she has
presented her work.

Dr. MacGregor also holds a MBA in General Management from UC Davis and a BA in
European History from UC Santa Cruz. Prior to her doctoral studies, she held
strategic management positions at Jamba Juice Company and Noah’s NY Bagels. In
addition, as a consultant and facilitator for the Institute for Business
Innovation at UC Berkeley, she lead student teams to develop and implement
strategic innovation solutions for firms such as Clorox, Panasonic, LAM
Research and Visa.
