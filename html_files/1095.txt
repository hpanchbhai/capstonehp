This paper empirically investigates whether and how social dynamics, in
combination with user past performance, drives purchase propensity in freemium
social games online. Two essential elements of freemium social games are (1)
social dynamics—users can perform various levels of social interactions, and
(2) freemium setting—users can play fully functional games for free, or make
multiple cash purchases to enhance their gaming experience. The key to success
of such flexible freemium games is to encourage users to make continued, large
purchases even though they could enjoy the product for free. Using an online
freemium social game data set, the authors find that both formal social groups
formed within the game and informal social connections influence purchase
decisions. Furthermore, informal social connections moderate the effect of
user past performance on spending. Managerially, the study proposes several
design and targeting strategies for freemium social games and other businesses
adopting a similar model, including fostering a social environment at various
levels; implementing targeted promotional activities based on social status
and social connections will benefit revenue in this flexible freemium context.
