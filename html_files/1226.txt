2015 Outstanding Student Entrepreneur Rico Mok  
Co-founder OneRent

###  

While still in high school, Rico Mok was already working on his own venture.
When he arrived at Santa Clara University, he was active in the Center for
Innovation and Entrepreneurship programs and the momentum continued.

He continued working on his initial startup, BuildACircle as it evolved into
Moments-Remembering the past,[www.ourmoments.co](http://www.ourmoments.co/).
An app launched in 2012 that helps you reminisce the past with the use of
location--your photos and moments captured in time to share and remember. Then
when you pass by places you've been, you'll receive a notification with your
photos and memories to enjoy all over again.  

Knowing that one startup wouldn't be enough to satisfy his enthusiastic
passion for entrepreneurship, Rico co-founded OneRent,
[onerent.co](http://www.onerent.co/),  in 2014 with fellow Broncos  Greg
Toschi, Evan Huang, and Chuck Hattemer.  OneRent is a Silicon Valley startup
at heart, originally launched as a leasing website to serve college students
looking for off-campus housing after being frustrated by the fragmented
process in place.  As time went on, OneRent recognized an opportunity with the
current infrastructure of the property management industry and took it upon
themselves to streamline the entire leasing and management experience to
develop a platform to forever change how the industry of property management
works.

In just 4 months of their initial launch at Santa Clara University, 150
properties in Santa Clara contracted with OneRent (70% of total availability),
200 tenant users during the 3 month beta, and 800 tenant users in one month
since the full launch.   Tenants and landlords alike enjoy the ease and peace
of mind of OneRent's easy to use system, which processes signatures digitally
through DocuSign, and partners with more than 20 major banks for online rent
and deposit transfer-more secure and convenient than checks.

Active in CIE Enrichment Opportunities like our quarterly Office Hours for
Entrepreneurs, Rico and his team has met with multiple alumni CIE Office Hours
providers to discuss OneRent.  The CIE also was pleased to feature the OneRent
team at well-received presentations to the CIE Advisory Board and as a part of
the CIE presentations at SCU's Family Weekend, showcasing student startups.
TheOneRent team also participated in CIE's Startup Expo career and internship
fair open to area startups, already giving back to the University by providing
internship and career opportunities for fellow students.

Rico is graduating with a major in Management Information Systems.  He is
indeed a shining example of what entrepreneurship at Santa Clara can do for
our communities.

He will receive this award at the Leavey School of Business Senior Awards
Ceremony on June 12 with a presentation by John Toppel, Dean's Executive
Professor of Management.  Congratulations!
