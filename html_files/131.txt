**April 1** for Scholarship Consideration  
 **June 1**  Final Deadline

##### Is GMAT/GRE required before I apply to the program?

applications. However, waivers are available for qualified applicants. The
GMAT/GRE must be taken prior to the deadline for which you are applying and we
do not allow for conditional acceptance while applicants prepare for the exam.

quiz.

##### What can you tell me about the GMAT and the GRE and is one weighed more
heavily than the other?

__

While the [**GMAT** (Graduate Management Admissions Test](http://www.mba.com))
has been the standard exam used for business schools, the [**GRE** (Graduate
Record Exam)](http://www.ets.org/gre) is also accepted. We do not prefer one
exam over the other.

Scores from either test are valid for five (5) years. Applicants are welcome
to take either exam more than once; we will only consider the highest score.

##### Am I required to come to campus for an interview?

__

Interviews are required, and you will be contacted regarding scheduling once
your application is complete. Non-local candidates have the option of a
virtual interview if he or she is unable to come to campus in person.

##### I have little work experience. Am I eligible to apply to Santa Clara's
MBA programs?

__

We prefer applicants have at least three years of work experience, however
applications are evaluated holistically. Applicants with less than three years
of work experience would be advised to present strong academics and test
scores. All interested students with a Bachelor's Degree are eligible to
apply.

##### Do you offer conditional acceptance?

__

We do not offer conditional acceptance under any circumstances.

##### What is a completed application and do I need to have all my documents
together before sending them to Santa Clara University?
