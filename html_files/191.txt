Ruta Zurauskyte

#### Financial Planning and Analysis Intern

![Ruta Zurauskyte portrait](/media/leavey-school-of-business/stories/lsb-
profiles/RZ14-ruta-aurauskyte-sq-crop-200x200.jpg)

Ruta Zurauskyte ’13, is a June 2014 graduate in the Master’s in Finance. She
received her bachelor’s in finance from the Leavey School of Business in 2013
and is now advising recently accepted MSF students.

**Why did you decide to enroll in the MSF program?**  
I specifically knew that I wanted to gain more knowledge in the field of
finance. Being able to complete the specialization capabilities of the program
in a relatively short amount of time really fit my needs.

**What doors do you hope a master's in finance will open for you?**  
I hope to pursue positions in the banking industry, investment and insurance
companies, as well as corporate finance roles. Because I am an international
student (F1 visa), the job search is challenging but since Silicon Valley is
so global in focus, companies are accustomed to an international workforce. My
internship, which I secured while I was enrolled, will help me prepare for
work in these companies.

**Why did you choose SCU over another graduate school?**  
Firstly, studying in the heart of the Silicon Valley is an invaluable
experience. And secondly, the professional and academic experience that
professors at SCU bring combined with the ability to tailor the program to my
career needs through many different electives really solidified my decision.
Of course, since I completed my bachelor's degree at SCU, choosing to continue
my master's studies here was a very easy decision.

**What do you hope the Leavey School of Business will do for you?**  
The extensive network of alumni at the Leavey School of Business is really
remarkable. At nearly every company I have applied to, I was able to connect
with the SCU alums and network prior to my interviews. I hope to stay in touch
with my classmates as well as other students and make the most out of the vast
network that SCU offers.

**What do you think of your experiences with the program so far?**  
I have really enjoyed my time in the program. I was able broaden my knowledge
of finance through many electives such as Financial Engineering, Data Science,
Financial Planning and Analysis and many others to really diversify my skills
and take my career to the next level.

**Has anything about the program surprised you?**  
I was a bit surprised at how much I was able to learn in the short 12 months
of my studies. I was really able to tailor the program to my career needs and
get the most out of my time as well as get a full-time job following my
graduation.

**Where are you currently interning?**  
I am currently a financial planning and analysis intern at Tibco Software in
Palo Alto. I am working with their tibbr and Loyalty Lab business units by
helping with the procurement process, forecasting and sales operations
finance.
