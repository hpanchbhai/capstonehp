Abstract:

Drawing on transaction cost theories and the resource-based view of a firm, we
posit that the value of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives is
greater in countries where an absence of market-supporting institutions
increases transaction costs and limits access to resources. Using a large
sample of 11,672 firm-year observations representing 2,445 unique firms from
53 countries during 2003-2010 and controlling for firm-level unobservable
heterogeneity, we find supportive evidence that CSR is more positively related
to firm value in countries with weaker market institutions. We also provide
evidence on the channels through which CSR initiatives reduce transaction
costs. We find that CSR is associated with improved access to financing in
countries with weaker equity and credit markets, greater investment and lower
default risk in countries with more limited business freedom, and longer trade
credit period and higher future sales growth in countries with weaker legal
institutions. Our findings provide new insights on non-market mechanisms such
as CSR through which firms can compensate for institutional voids.
