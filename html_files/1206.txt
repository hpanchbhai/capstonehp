  7. Madi Clelland: The Data Behind the Business 

## Madi Clelland: The Data Behind the Business

Madi discusses her responsibilities with the Cristo Rey Work Study Program.



![LSB Community Fellows 2017-18](/media/leavey-school-of-
business/undergraduates/npi-and-lsb-community-fellows/maddie-300x300-1.jpg)

This past quarter I have been focusing on the different reports that Cristo
Rey Work Study uses to gauge the health of the program. These reports are
pulled from SalesForce and measure a variety of metrics. The reports include
details about students and their work placements. In addition, the reports
display ratings that convey how the participating companies feel about the
program. My main project has been organizing these reports into one succinct
dashboard so supervisors can easily see which students may need additional
help.

At first, I felt like I was simply staring at pages of numbers with no
direction or idea of where to start. However, after slowing down and
remembering the work that I have completed in classes at Santa Clara I felt
that I had the necessary groundwork to break down the project into manageable
parts. I also felt confident in my ability to synthesize the information so I
could understand what the problem was with the current system and how best to
fix it.

Overall, this project has helped me understand how data is used in day-to-day
business activities, specifically in the realm of non-profits. Prior to this
project, I felt like utilizing data resources could only be done effectively
if the problem was already diagnosed or if there was a minute issue that I was
looking for and wanted to know more about it. Furthermore, it helped me
characterize non-profits such as Cristo Rey in a more classical business
sense.

In addition to  building my hard skills, this project helped me learn more
about the students I have been working with. It has been hard to meet as many
as I would like and get to know them on a personal level. Through learning
about their struggles and successes at school, I have been able to meet more
students  and talk about their experiences with them. As I move further into
the school year, I will be working on more projects focused around student
success in their placements which will help me forge even stronger
relationships!
