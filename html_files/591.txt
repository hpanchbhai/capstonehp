About

The SCU Economics Student Association is a student organization dedicated to
offering networking opportunities to economics majors and minors in both the
College of Arts and Sciences and the Leavey School of Business. The
association organizes informal and formal events and activities that are
designed to help students build relationships with professors, alumni,
potential employers, and each other.

During the 2017-2018 school year, the association put on a series of events
geared toward students. We held an informational panel, where current
students, alumni, and graduate students discussed their experiences outside of
the classroom in the workforce or graduate school. We held an ice cream social
for majors and minors to meet each other in a casual environment. And finally,
we hosted numerous officer meetings as well as opportunities for involvement.
