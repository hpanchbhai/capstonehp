## Joint Logistics and Financial Services by a 3PL Firm

Gangshu (George) Cai, Xiangfeng Chen

European Journal of Operational Research, Vol. 214(3), p. 579-587, 2011.

Abstract:

Integrated logistics and financial services have been practiced bythird party
logistics (3PL)firms for years; however, the literature has been silent on the
value of 3PL firms as creditproviders in budget-constrained supply chains.
This paper investigates an extended supplychain model with a supplier, a
budget-constrained retailer, a bank,and a 3PL firm, in whichthe retailer has
insufficient initial budget and may borrow or obtain trade credit from either
abank (traditional role) or a 3PL firm (control role). Our analysis indicates
that the control rolemodel yields higher profits not only for the 3PL firm but
also for the supplier, the retailer, and the entire supply chain. In
comparison with a supplier credit model where the supplier providesthe trade
credit, the control role model yields a better performance for the supply
chain as longas the 3PL firm’s marginal profit is greater than that of the
supplier. We further demonstratethat, for all players, both the control role
and supplier credit models can outperform the classicnewsvendor model without
budget constraint.
