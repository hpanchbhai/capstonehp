"Discussion of Foreign Ownership and Real Earnings Management: Evidence in
Japan")

* * *

Abstract:

Guo, Huang, Zhang, and Zhou (2015) examine whether foreign investors encourage
or limit real earnings management in Japanese firms. They find that firms with
higher foreign ownership engage less in real earnings management than other
firms as evidenced by higher abnormal cash flows from operations, lower
abnormal production costs, and higher abnormal discretionary expenses. While
the results suggest that foreign ownership and real earnings management in
Japanese firms are negatively correlated, it remains unclear whether foreign
investors improve the corporate governance of firms and thus limit real
earnings management or that they are attracted to firms that have better
governance and more transparent earnings. One fruitful avenue for future
research is to examine whether the negative relation between foreign ownership
and financial reporting quality reflects monitoring by foreign investors or
selection.
