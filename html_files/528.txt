# Employers / Recruiters

  4. Employers / Recruiters 

There is a reason why over 65% of the Fortune 1000 rely on CEP expertise.

Employers and recruiters know that the administration of an equity
compensation program requires skills and expertise.  The Certified Equity
Professional Institute is the  _only_  source of professional certification
for equity compensation professionals.

![Man walking in front of buildings](/media/leavey-school-of-
business/cepi/Business-Man.png)



#### The CEP designation provides:

  * The highest industry standard for knowledge in the equity compensation field
  * The tools to serve as a liaison between internal and external constituencies
  * Technical knowledge required to manage equity compensation issues and identify potential compliance issues.





Complying with the complex requirements of accounting, tax and securities
regulations governing equity compensation plans has become a major challenge
for many companies. Companies can minimize the risk of noncompliance by
ensuring that a CEP is involved in their stock plans. To become a CEP, an
individual must demonstrate an advanced level of knowledge and understanding
of equity compensation programs and pass a set of rigorous examinations. CEPs
are subject to professional standards, including continuing professional
education.  With these rigorous requirements, it is no wonder that so many
companies _insist_ on having CEP expertise manage their equity plans.

Individuals with the CEP designation can be identified

Business » Certified Equity Professional Institute » Current CEPs  » Active
Designees").
