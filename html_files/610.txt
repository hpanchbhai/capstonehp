**The LSB Community  Fellows Application Process  
**

The LSB Community Fellowship Program places SCU business students in paid
internships in local non-profit organizations, providing opportunities to use
business skills in an organization that serves low-income communities or
individuals. It is a way to contribute to the community while developing your
skills and building your base of experience in organizations.

The details:  
LSB Community Fellows commit 10 hours/week to the fellowship (schedule
determined in collaboration with organizational supervisor), beginning in Fall
quarter and continuing for winter and spring quarters, except during finals
weeks and school breaks. Fellows are paid at the rate of $16 per hour; funds
are provided by the Leavey School of Business. Please [click
here](/business/undergraduates/community/community-fellows/blog/ "Home » Home
» Leavey School of Business » Undergraduates » Community & Campus Involvement
» Neighborhood Prosperity Initiative » NPI Blog") to read about the experience
of past Fellows.

Fellows also enroll in a 1-unit seminar (BUSN 183) during each quarter. The
seminar, co-facilitated by Economics Professor Bill Sundstrom and Professor of
Practice Jackie Schmidt-Posner, provides an opportunity for reflection on
experience, sharing of knowledge with other Fellows, professional development,
and conceptual background on the economic context of Silicon Valley. Early in
Fall quarter the Fellows attend an overnight retreat designed to build a sense
of community and give the Fellows an opportunity to formulate their goals.

NOTE: The internship period is from late September – early June. Fellows must
be enrolled as students in good standing on campus in fall, winter and spring
quarters to qualify. Students are responsible for providing their own
transportation to the placement site.

An information session will be held on Tuesday, April 9, from 4pm to 5:30pm,
in Lucas 201, if you would like to learn more about the program.

2019-2020 Community placements will be announced in May, 2019.
