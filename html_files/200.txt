The [minor in international business](/business/undergraduates/international-
business-minor/ "Home » Home » Leavey School of Business » Undergraduates »
International Business Minor") is designed to educate students in a broad
range of management and business skills in a global context. The program
includes coursework in language, social science, and international business
and is open to all undergraduate students. The minor provides students with an
understanding of the social, economic, and political context of international
business, the language communication skills, and the business skills to be
effective managers in a global marketplace. Students are encouraged to
participate in a study abroad program or internship to complement this minor.

##### Entrepreneurship Minor

__

Find the [entrepreneurship minor requirements
here](/business/undergraduates/entrepreneurship-minor/ "Home » Home » Leavey
School of Business » Undergraduates » Entrepreneurship Minor").

If you're interested in either developing a business or working in a startup
with the chance to explore entrepreneurship as a career option and acquire the
skills that can help them be successful.

Students completing the [entrepreneurship
minor](/business/undergraduates/entrepreneurship-minor/ "Home » Home » Leavey
School of Business » Undergraduates » Entrepreneurship Minor") will develop an
understanding of the venture creation process including how to generate and
develop a new business concept, apply quantitative and qualitative methods and
analytical tools to identify and evaluate entrepreneurial opportunities, use
data and analysis to create and evaluate a business plan, and evaluate
different funding sources for a new venture. A critical element of the program
is an internship working with an emerging for-profit startup or socially-
beneficial organization to develop an in-depth case study of the venture and
founders, formal business plan or growth plan.

The entrepreneurship minor is open to all students via an application process
through the Management Department. Accepted business school students may begin
the minor courses after they have completed 60 units. For students outside the
business school, prerequisites for MGMT 164 should ideally be completed in the
sophomore year. International students MUST contact the Global Engagement
Office for information on internship eligibility.
