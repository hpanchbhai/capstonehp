## Behavioral Efficient Markets.

Meir Statman

##### Meir Statman

Meir Statman was named winner of the top prize in the Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs
Levy Awards.

**Meir Statman** takes top Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy award for his article
"Behavioral Efficient Markets."

Abstract:

Discussions about market efficiency in finance are unfocused when they fail to
distinguish between the price-equals-value market hypothesis and the hard-to-
beat market hypothesis. And discussions are further lacking when they fail to
explain why so many investors believe that markets are easy to beat when, in
truth, they are hard to beat.

As described in Finance for Normal People and this article, behavioral finance
contributes positively to these discussions by making the distinction between
the price-equals-value market hypothesis and the hard-to-beat market
hypothesis and by explaining why so many investors believe that markets are
easy to beat when, in truth, that is hard to do.

Behavioral finance concludes that markets are not price-equals-value markets
but they are rather hard-to-beat for investors lacking exclusively or
narrowly-available information. And behavioral finance elucidates the
cognitive and emotional errors that mislead investors with nothing but widely-
available information into the belief that markets are easy to beat.
