Amy Yao

#### Supply Chain Planning Staff Program Manager

**Before she began her graduate business degree program at Santa Clara
University** , Amy Yao was working in the high tech industry as a global
logistics project manager. Today, as an alumna of the Leavey School of
Business, she’s a data science supply chain strategist for Seagate Technology,
partly due to the challenging courses and inspiring faculty at the business
school.

A self-described “renegade” whose heroes include Margaret Thatcher and the
underdogs described in Malcom Gladwell’s _David and Goliath_ , Yao was eager
to take on more responsibility and found the MBA program in the Leavey School
of Business a good fit. She says her coursework at SCU, including one
exploring neuroscience and sales and one called “Spirits of the New
Workplace,” continues to open doors to new fields. “Learning regression
analysis in John Heineke’s class has paved the way to my involvement in data
science today,” she notes.

As supply chain strategist at Seagate, she is deploying big data methods to
ensure the hard drive leader is the first to utilize Advance Planning Systems
(APS), and was recently a speaker for the Gartner Supply Chain Forum.

She also sees the supply chain management function becoming central to
profitability, especially in the global technology capital of the world.
“Supply chain management is so much more than the traditional notion of
warehousing and physical distribution. It’s an exciting discipline that has
matured over the last few decades, and is about to be even more complex and
interesting with the emergence of IoT (“Internet of Things”) and data science
application for operations.”

Yao thinks SCU is perfectly positioned to create an emerging generation of
supply chain managers, offering the only graduate degree in the discipline in
northern California. “Silicon Valley is teeming with companies that are
competing in the high tech industry, which has characteristically fast product
life cycle and thrives on innovation. Supply chain management is a great
skillset to have to be an operational caretaker as well as a growth partner,”
she says.

She received her B.S. in business administration from the University of
Southern California, and her MBA from SCU in 2011.
