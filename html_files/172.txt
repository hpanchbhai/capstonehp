##### Recruiting Resources

__

The Graduate Business Career Management office in Lucas Hall 116 is the
primary resource for GBP students. Our office partners with the University
Career Center who manages the following recruiting programs also available to
you.

**On-Campus Interviewing (OCI)**  
The On-Campus Interviewing program offers targeted internship and full-time
positions for graduate business students. OCI is offered in fall, winter and
spring quarters, with the majority of the recruiting happening in the fall and
winter quarters. OCI is a very small part of the services for Graduate
Business Career Management. Few recruiters come to campus for this program,
although they engage with us for graduate business hiring, on-campus career
networking events, industry panels, Handshake and our LinkedIn Group. Career
Management continuously works to build relationships with key employers.

To register for On-Campus Interviewing, follow these steps:

  1. Register for a Leavey Career Net account. This is your access point for GBP job boards. If you don’t already have an account, [fill out the New User Account Request here](https://gtscandidate.mbafocus.com/SantaClara/Candidates/Login.aspx?pid=1609) »
  2. Prepare your resume in the one-page required template and submit it for approval through Leavey Career Net. See the [Resume webpage](https://www.scu.edu/business/graduates/career-management/students/resumes/ "Home » Home » Leavey School of Business » Current Students » Career Management » Students » Resumes") for many great resources to help you build an effective resume.

You will receive feedback from a career consultant via email within three to
five business days. You may continue to work directly with the consultant to
get an approved resume to activate your Leavey Career Net account and
Handshake account.
