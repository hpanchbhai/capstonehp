## Masters of Science in Information Systems (MSIS)

### Become a part of the future in the tech capital of the world.

Information systems drive business. All the way from the companies that build
the technology itself to disparate disciplines such as construction,
education, and banking—the speed of business is dependent on IS. Our MSIS is
born of and lives in Silicon Valley. Led by faculty recruited from top
companies, our project-based curriculum draws from real-world challenges that
you can put to use immediately.

Program Overview

• Program duration: Flexible program length from 16 to 24 months.

• Time/schedule: Evening/Saturday classes to balance work, life, and study.

• Course delivery: Tailored class schedule to build foundations and to meet
your interest and needs.

### Learn how to design and build the information systems that shape the
future, no matter what your undergraduate degree is.

We constantly refresh our STEM-approved curriculum at Silicon Valley speed to
offer you both the fundamentals that you need for success and the latest
technology such a machine learning, data science, or mobile programming for a
profile that excites your future employer.  You crown your time at Santa Clara
University with a capstone project that allows you to solve an important
problem for one of our Silicon Valley company partners or to pursue an own
idea that may end up to be the nucleus of your own company. You choose, you
excel.
